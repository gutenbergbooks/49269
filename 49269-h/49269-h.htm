<h1 title="">The Boy Scouts in the Saddle.</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I.
<br /><span class="small">THE SUPERIOR BOY.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! there, landlord, just put five gallons
of gasoline in my tank, and charge it to
dad, will you? I forgot to fill up before leaving
our garage in town. I reckon there&rsquo;d
be a lot of trouble in the big granite quarry we
own if Gusty Merrivale failed to show up
to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The speaker was a young fellow nattily attired,
of about eighteen years of age. As he
nimbly jumped out of the dusty runabout car,
it could be seen that he was inclined to be
rather arrogant in his manner. Indeed, one
glance at his dark, handsome face betrayed
the fact that he was more or less proud, and
domineering.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>Gustavus Merrivale was comparatively a
newcomer in the pleasant town around which
many of the adventures contained in this
Scout Series happened. Somehow Gusty had
not seemed to care to mix with the general
run of boys, picking up only a few choice companions
from among the &ldquo;upper crust.&rdquo; His
father was said to be a very wealthy man, and
among other properties, he owned a logging
camp far up among the hills together with a
valuable granite quarry where fully five score
of toilers were employed throughout the entire
summer.</p>
<p>The landlord of the village tavern apparently
knew his customer. Several times before
young Merrivale had motored through the village,
and always just two weeks apart. By
putting two and two together, the tavern
keeper could easily surmise the nature of the
errand that took Gus Merrivale up into that
wild country so often. Had he been in doubt
before, these last words of the boy must have
enlightened him fully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pay day in the quarry, hey?&rdquo; he went on
to say, as he unlocked the reservoir that doubtless
contained the supply of gasoline which he
sold to passing tourists and others. &ldquo;Your
pa&rsquo;s got quite a plenty of men employed up
there, I understand, Mr. Merrivale; and just
as you say, they&rsquo;d kick up high jinks if their
pay didn&rsquo;t show up on Monday twice a month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, hello! Where did that bunch of motorcycles
come from, Mr. Tubbs?&rdquo; demanded
the rich man&rsquo;s son, pointing, as he spoke, to
three up-to-date twin-cylinder machines standing
in a cluster in a safe corner of the inn
yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three young chaps from your town are sitting
yonder on the porch awatchin&rsquo; of us right
now,&rdquo; returned the landlord, softly. &ldquo;Mebbe
you happen to know them, seeing as how
they&rsquo;re Boy Scouts, and that Hugh Hardin
has made somethin&rsquo; of a name around this
section, I&rsquo;m told.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh Hardin, eh?&rdquo; exclaimed young Merrivale
with a swift glance toward the side
piazza of the tavern, where he now discovered
several sprawling figures occupying as many
chairs, and evidently resting up while waiting
for dinner to be announced. &ldquo;Yes, and his
shadow, that Worth fellow, is along with him,
and also the chap they call Monkey Stallings,
who came to town just a month after I did.
He fell in with that common herd right away,
and joined the troop, but none of that silly
scout business for me! I can see myself taking
orders from a patrol leader, nit. What
are they doing away up here; and where did
they get those expensive machines, I&rsquo;d like to
know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It happens that I&rsquo;m able to supply the information,
Mr. Merrivale,&rdquo; remarked the landlord
quickly. Like most of his class, he enjoyed
a chance to gossip and disseminate news
which he had picked up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then I wish you&rsquo;d be so kind and condescending
as to inform me right away, sir.
I was just speaking about getting a motorcycle
myself; and even now I&rsquo;m expecting a
bunch of catalogues from which to select a
machine. Those things cost all of two hundred
apiece, and I fancy few boys have got as
indulgent a father as I happen to own. So
please go on and give me the facts, Mr.
Tubbs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you see, the Stallings boy has money
of his own, and the others have been laying
aside dollars right along, most of them earned
by finding wild ginseng and golden rod roots
in the woods. Besides, they say that Hardin
boy did something not long ago that brought
him in quite a fat reward, which he insisted
on sharing with the chums who happened to
be with him at the time. I kinder guess that
Worth boy was along, and that helped <i>him</i>
out. Anyhow, they&rsquo;re taking their first long
run, and have come something like seventy
miles since breakfast at home. I&rsquo;m getting a
dinner for them, you know. Perhaps you&rsquo;d
like to stay over a bit and see what kind of a
cook my wife is?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>&ldquo;What, me take pot luck with that crowd?&rdquo;
exclaimed Gus Merrivale with a curl of his
upper lip. &ldquo;Well, I hardly know them enough
to speak to at home, and it isn&rsquo;t likely that
I&rsquo;ll put myself out to improve the slight acquaintance.
This scout business makes me
sick. I don&rsquo;t understand what the fellows see
in it to strut around in their old khaki suits,
and salute whenever they meet some one who
happens to be higher up in line. Bah! catch
me standing at attention and raising my hand
when Hugh Hardin chances to pass by. If I
could be an assistant scout master in the start,
I might get a little fun out of the game; but
to commence at the lowest rung of the ladder&mdash;well,
excuse me, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>The landlord bent lower to hide the smile
that flitted across his face. He knew just what
type of high-strung boy young Merrivale was;
and also had his own opinion as to how difficult
it is to mix oil and water. From what
he had observed, he understood how thoroughly
those three lads lolling on his porch
just then, were infatuated with the new life
that had opened up to them since they threw
in their fortunes with the scout movement. He
had heard them talking, and found himself
deeply interested in what they told of discoveries.
There was enough of the woodsman in
Uriah Tubbs to appreciate the sentiments they
expressed. He, too, many a time had listened
to the voice of Nature when alone in the
wilds, and could understand how fascinating
it must be to the right kind of boy to be able
to unravel many of her secrets.</p>
<p>Evidently young Merrivale would not bother
investigating in order to find out what it was
that lured these scouts on day after day. He
saw only the surface indications, and resolutely
refused to pry off the lid that hid the
wonderful truth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>The landlord did not attempt to enlighten
him. There was something about young Merrivale
that he did not exactly fancy&mdash;a curl of
disdain to his upper lip, just as though he considered
himself a superior person and above
the herd. So Mr. Tubbs simply applied himself
to the task of measuring out the necessary
liquid fuel for which his customer had asked.</p>
<p>When Gusty Merrivale chanced to look
toward the porch, one of the three loungers
waved a hand at him after the customary
free-masonry of youth. The driver of the
runabout made a careless motion as though
meaning to acknowledge the friendly salute,
yet not wishing to allow any undue familiarity.
As the trio of scouts seemed to be very
well satisfied with each other&rsquo;s company, it
was hardly likely that any one of them would
go out of his way to scrape a closer acquaintance
with so frigid and reserved a person.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>And yet, Hugh Hardin, the tall, agile chap
who wore the badge of patrol leader and assistant
scout master on his khaki coat, had told
himself more than once that the new arrival
in town might make a splendid addition to
the ranks of the troop, if only he could drop
that superior air, and meet others on a level.
Several times had Hugh endeavored to become
better acquainted with Gus Merrivale, only to
be rebuffed, and made to feel as though he
were thrusting himself in where he was not
wanted; so, in time, he had given the idea up.</p>
<p>When the required amount of gasoline had
been placed aboard, the young driver of the
road car sprang into his seat. He knew that
the three scouts on the porch were watching
him closely, but not for worlds would he look
that way, lest he be compelled to wave his hand
again; and to his mind that would seem too
much like saluting.</p>
<p>His car did not need cranking, having a self-starter
installed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Tubbs. I expect to
pass back this way later on in the day. Those
steep hills give my car quite a pull you know!&rdquo;
he sang out as he threw on the power and
started out of the inn yard, presently to vanish
amidst a cloud of dust up the road.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>For some little distance young Merrivale
made good time. He liked to fairly fly along,
being possessed of a rather nervous disposition.
As the ascent became more pronounced,
his pace slackened considerably.</p>
<p>The country had changed also. Instead of
farming land on either hand, he looked upon
dense woods, and hills that seemed to be composed
of almost solid rock, though trees managed
to find lodgment in crevices, so that they
hid the rough conformation of the ground. It
had been somewhere in this neighborhood that
members of the Boy Scout troop had come during
the previous summer when deeply interested
in geological study; and, indeed, they
could hardly have found a place better fitted
for the purpose of yielding up valuable information.</p>
<p>Gus Merrivale, however, only considered his
surroundings in a mercenary way. His father
owned thousands of acres of such land, as well
as the logging camp, located there when snow
covered the country. Five score of husky
Italians labored in the granite quarry all
through eight months of open weather.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>By degrees his car began to climb steep
grades. It had evidently been carefully selected
with just this capacity for mounting
hills in view; and steadily it kept pulling the
lone occupant upward.</p>
<p>Now and then he could catch splendid views
of the lowlands, and from the eager way in
which Gus looked out at such opportune moments,
it seemed as though after all he had a
touch of admiration for Nature.</p>
<p>In the course of half an hour he had arrived
close to a peculiar spot where the road ran
along near a steep precipice. A stout railing
had been erected, under the supervision
of the township freeholders who had charge
of bridges and roads, in order to lessen the
chances of any vehicle toppling over from that
dizzy height. From this point, as Gus well
knew, he would be able to obtain a splendid
view not only of the road far below but of
the distant country where several villages and
towns lay, with their church spires showing
above the trees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>For a short distance before arriving at this
place, the road lay level, and here he naturally
let out his car so as to make up for lost time.</p>
<p>As he turned a bend, and leaned slightly forward
with the intention of cutting down his
rather reckless pace, he suddenly saw something
that gave him a severe shock.</p>
<p>This was nothing less than a fallen tree
across the road, hardly more than a sapling in
fact, but enough of an impediment to have
thrown his car aside and brought about a
wreck, had he not noticed it in time. And even
as he wildly threw on the brake, he saw the
figure of a man, bearing a massive shining
tin star on the left breast of his faded coat,
spring out from the bushes waving his arms
violently and shouting excitedly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! hold up there, mister! You&rsquo;re exceeding
the speed limit ahittin&rsquo; up a pace like that!
I&rsquo;m the Squeehonk constable, and I kinder
guess I&rsquo;ll have to run you in for breakin&rsquo; the
law! This is an ortomobile trap, understand?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II.
<br /><span class="small">LEFT ON THE LEDGE.</span></h2>
<p>The runabout came to a standstill not five
feet away from the sapling that had been
thrown across the road in order to prevent him
from slipping by. It was an angry boy who
jumped out and faced the man, who seemed
to enjoy his confusion, if the broad grin on
his ugly face could be taken for any indication.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, stopping me like this
away up here in the wilderness, and then telling
me I&rsquo;m exceeding the speed limit?&rdquo; Gus
hotly demanded. &ldquo;You say you&rsquo;re a constable,
but where is this village of Squeehonk, I&rsquo;d like
to know? I&rsquo;ve been up here several times and
never ran across so much as a cabin, let alone
a village. Why, my father owns pretty near
half of this country up this way, I&rsquo;d like you
to know. My name is Gustavus Merrivale, understand?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>That was just like Gusty, inclined to brag
of the great possessions of his family. Perhaps
he was under the false impression that,
at the mere mention of his name, the country
clodhopper would exhibit great alarm, and begin
to beg his pardon for having dared to
spring his automobile trap as he had.</p>
<p>Somehow the fellow failed to be dismayed
at learning whom he had stopped on the public
road. The grin even widened perceptibly,
and on seeing this fact, the young driver of
the roadster grew red in the face with increased
anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to take that tree off the
highway and allow me to go on; or will I have
to report this brazen hold-up to my father, and
get you punished?&rdquo; he exclaimed hotly, pointing
as he spoke to the obstruction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>Then, as he happened to glance at the shining
star that decorated the breast of the so-called
constable, he discovered that it was made
of <i>tin</i>, and very crudely fashioned in the bargain,
as though some difficulty had been experienced
in cutting out the insignia of office.
This fact caused Gus to look at things in a
new light. He even began to wonder whether
the man who had stopped him might not be
some escaped lunatic who fancied that his sole
duty in life was to hold up speed cars and
make the drivers recognize his authority.</p>
<p>Now that the boy took the trouble to observe
the fellow more closely, he discovered
that he seemed to be rather a hard looking
customer. There was a cruel gleam in his pale
eyes that gave promise of merciless treatment,
should he once become aroused and infuriated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go slow, younker,&rdquo; advised the man, with
a noticeable sneer. &ldquo;Cool your engine off a
mite while you have the chance. I&rsquo;ll turn that
sapling aside when I get good and ready, and
not a minute before, even if you are in such a
hurry. So, you say you&rsquo;re Old Merrivale&rsquo;s
boy, do you? And like as not right now you&rsquo;re
heading for the quarries up yonder with the
payroll money along? How about it, younker?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>His words gave Gusty a thrill. For the first
time a suspicion flashed through his brain that
this hold-up might stand for something more
serious than the mad whim of an escaped
lunatic; or the silly design of a country constable
to line his own pocket with graft money
forced from the owners of passing cars, whom
he might threaten to arrest for violating the
speed limits.</p>
<p>The mention of the payroll money reminded
the boy of his charge. There were several
thousand dollars in bills and silver in the stout
bag that he had placed under the seat of the
runabout, enough to tempt many a desperate
man to take the chances of robbery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>He had been given a revolver by his father
to carry along with him whenever he had to
take the semimonthly cash up to the quarries.
Unfortunately, the weapon happened to be
under the cushion of the seat. He wondered
what the man would do if he started to try
to get hold of this little gun, and if the fellow
was desperate enough to strike him on the
head with the stout stick he carried in his
right hand.</p>
<p>Another thing gave Gusty further cause for
alarm. The bushes close by rustled, and a
second fellow came into view. He was a
shorter hobo than the one who had pretended
to play the part of country constable; but if
anything his face, rough with a week&rsquo;s stubble
beard, looked more villainous than that of his
companion.</p>
<p>Plainly, if anything was to be done, it was
high time he started in to make a move before
the others could join forces. At least Gusty
Merrivale did not seem to be a coward, no
matter if he did put on superior airs and imagine
himself above the common run of boys
who went to make up the rank and file of the
scouts. His actions proved this fact, for without
waiting to ask further questions, or figure
on what the consequences might be, he made a
quick whirl on his heel, and jumped toward
the road car.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>Of course, his intention was simply to arm
himself, so as to meet the others on something
like a fair footing. There was no way of
escaping while that tree blocked the road, and
certainly these rascals would not dream of allowing
him to turn around and retire the way
he had come.</p>
<p>Before the boy could throw back the cushion
so as to seize upon the weapon that snuggled
under it, a heavy figure came down full upon
him. In vain did Gusty try to wriggle loose
from the encircling arms that held him in a
fierce hug resembling the clasp of a wrestling
bear. Gusty was fully aroused and fought like
a savage wildcat. All the while he was shouting
out words that voiced his indignation, and
carried wild threats as to what would happen
to these scoundrels for daring to stop him on
the road and rob him of his trust.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>Despite his furious exertions, the man held
him until his companion reached the spot, and
more than a few heavy blows were dealt because
the flying fists of the excited boy happened
to land in the fellow&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let up on that tomfoolery, younker,&rdquo;
snarled the second man, scowling blackly in
the face of the prisoner, &ldquo;or me an&rsquo; my pal&rsquo;ll
have to give yuh some medicine that mebbe
yuh won&rsquo;t like. Think as how we&rsquo;d let yuh
reach for a gun? Well, not any, I reckons.
Pete, yuh started his nose tuh bleedin&rsquo; lively
last time yuh touched him up. Hope yuh didn&rsquo;t
break it and spile his good looks for keeps.
Now, stand still, I tells yuh, &rsquo;less yuh wants
us tuh kick yuh out o&rsquo; your senses. We figgered
on gittin&rsquo; that bank roll, an&rsquo; there&rsquo;s no
way yuh kin save it, so let up and make the
most o&rsquo; a bad bargain. Reckon as how yuh
dad he&rsquo;s got heaps more o&rsquo; this stuff whar
it kim from. We needs it in our business,
Pete an&rsquo; me. And this here kyar&rsquo;ll jest suit
us tuh ride away in, see?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>Quivering with indignation, sore from his
bruises, and almost out of breath after the
furious struggle with his tall captor, young
Merrivale realized that they intended to make
a complete job of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that you&rsquo;ll steal my car as
well as that bag of cash?&rdquo; he demanded,
aghast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; replied the tall hobo yeggman,
still holding him fast. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d be a nice pair
of chumps now, wouldn&rsquo;t we, to give you a
chance to make hot time up to the quarry, and
start all that crowd of wild Italians after us?
I happen to know something about running a
gas wagon, so I guess we c&rsquo;n make out to
keep clear of ditches and jump-offs. Bill, get
that rope we had in the bushes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do with a rope?&rdquo;
asked Gus, turning a trifle pale as he noticed
that there was a straight limb growing out
from the trunk of the nearest tree close by,
which would offer a very fine chance for raising
any one off the ground, did lawless persons
feel inclined that way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just wait and see,&rdquo; the tall hobo replied;
&ldquo;but we ain&rsquo;t agoin&rsquo; to risk our precious necks
adoing anything that&rsquo;d call for capital punishment.
We draw the line there, me&rsquo;nd Bill.
And hark to me, young Merrivale, all the kicking
on earth won&rsquo;t help you a mite, and&rsquo;ll only
cause us to bang you up some more. So if
you&rsquo;re half as sensible as I take you to be, you&rsquo;ll
just hold tight, and let us work our will. It&rsquo;s
all planned out, and nothing&rsquo;ll make us change
things the least bit. Let that soak in, and it&rsquo;ll
pay you lots better than trying to fight back
when you ain&rsquo;t got no chance at all. See?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gus only gave a groan of despair. Yes, he
realized that it would be the utmost folly for
him to try and fight two strong men. He could
not hope to escape, and in their anger they
would be apt to do him more bodily injury.
The mention made of a broken nose rather
tamed his aggressive spirit because Gus was
very vain of his good looks, and would almost
as soon die as be maimed in such a way as to
render him hideous in the eyes of others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>Bill quickly reappeared from the bushes.
He was carrying a stout rope that might have
been twenty feet or so in length, and which
these rogues had doubtless stolen from some
person&rsquo;s backyard where it had served as a
clothes line.</p>
<p>Perhaps it had originally been their design
to make use of the rope in order to stop the
pay car. The discovery of an overturned sapling
however had suggested an easier method
of proceeding. Bill hastened to arrange a loop
at one end of the rope. This he passed over
the head of the boy, and the touch of the noose
on his face sent a cold chill all through the
body of the helpless prisoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fix it just under his arms, Bill,&rdquo; commanded
the tall man. &ldquo;I warn you to keep still,
younker, if you know what&rsquo;s best for you. No
matter what you say, or try to do, you can&rsquo;t
change our plans. We mean to keep you here,
so as to hold back the alarm as long as we can,
which&rsquo;ll give us a chance to cover many miles,
if your dinky old car holds out. Now, walk
over here with us, and you&rsquo;ll grip on what the
scheme is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>With one on either side Gusty was compelled
to advance, and he noted with considerable
trepidation that it was directly toward the
precipice that they led him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t hang me over there like this,
would you?&rdquo; he ejaculated, as a terrible
thought flashed into his mind. &ldquo;Why, before
long this rope would cut into me so I&rsquo;d be
crazy with pain. Tie me to a tree if you want,
so I can&rsquo;t get away, but don&rsquo;t put me over
there, please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would have to be something beyond the
common that could make a proud boy like
Gusty Merrivale plead with anyone; but for
the time being he forgot his haughty spirit, nor
was it to be wondered at, considering the peril
he faced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use wastin&rsquo; yer breath, kid,&rdquo; snarled the
shorter hobo. &ldquo;We laid out our plans an&rsquo; we
means tuh kerry the same through, don&rsquo;t we,
Pete?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t quite as bad as you thinks, younker,&rdquo;
added the other man, who seemed to have
just a grain of pity in his nature. &ldquo;&rsquo;Bout
twelve or fifteen feet down the face of the
precipice there&rsquo;s a ledge that runs along a little
ways. No goat could ever get up or down
from that same place. We&rsquo;re meaning to land
you there, drop the short rope, and leave you
till somebody happens to come along, which
might be in one hour, and mebbe not till night
sets in. The rope is ten times too short for you
to use it in lowering yourself down, so you&rsquo;ve
just got to hold the fort. Now, lay back, and
no kicking remember, because you might make
us let go, and that&rsquo;d mean a tumble on the
rocks two hundred feet below here. Steady
now, Bill, wait till I give the word, and lower
away slow like. Make the best of a bad bargain,
younker. Remember, we might a done
worse by you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>Afraid to struggle, and holding his very
breath with dreadful suspense, the boy felt
himself being lowered through empty space.
He could look far down toward the winding
road, and a wave of horror chilled him to the
core as he contemplated his fate should the
men let the rope slip through their hands, or
should some weak spot in the line develop
that would cause it to part.</p>
<p>Foot by foot he was lowered, until he felt
his feet strike the rock. He had reached the
ledge spoken of, and eagerly he endeavored to
secure a firm footing there, even sinking to his
hands and knees and holding on.</p>
<p>The rope fell beside him, proving that the
men had done as they had said they intended
to. A minute or two later, the wretched youth
heard the rapid working of the runabout&rsquo;s
exhaust, telling him that the robbers had
started off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III.
<br /><span class="small">SURROUNDED BY PERILS.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;This is a pretty kettle of fish, I must say!&rdquo;
Gus muttered as he heard the last low grumble
of the runabout die away up the ascent, proving
that the hoboes had indeed abandoned him
there to his fate.</p>
<p>He started in to examine his surroundings
more carefully than before; but he found very
little encouragement. The sheer wall arose
for possibly a dozen feet above his head, with
not the slightest sign of any projection that
might serve him in an endeavor to reach the
mountain road where the protecting railing
lay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>It is a sudden emergency like this that shows
what a fellow is made of. Young Merrivale
had certain qualities about him that might be
deemed objectionable in the eyes of boys who
are ready to give and take. He wanted to be
a leader, or not play. In the past, indeed, he
had been more or less domineering in his treatment
of those with whom he condescended to
associate.</p>
<p>He was no coward, and while still burning
with indignation toward the pair of rascals
who had taken not only the pay money of the
quarrymen but his runabout as well, his one
thought was to get out of this scrape some
way or other, and then follow them. He gritted
his teeth as he thought of the glory that
would be his could he only overtake the
wretches and bring back the stolen property.</p>
<p>If not above, perhaps he might find safety
below. It was, of course, a long way down to
the bottom of the declivity. He had climbed
steeps before, however, where the valuable
granite had been blasted from the face of the
mountain, leaving great gaps and towering
cliffs where even a nimble-footed goat would
find it difficult to discover safe footing.</p>
<p>So Gus crawled to the edge of the ledge
and looked over.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! it would take a steeple-jack to make
that drop without breaking every bone in his
body!&rdquo; he told himself when he saw how far
below lay the rocky base of the precipice, and
marked the lack of friendly crevices and protuberances.</p>
<p>With his teeth still firmly pressed together,
he forced himself to examine every foot of
the surface of the hard rock as far as it could
be seen from his aerie. &ldquo;If my rope were
only two or three times as long as it is, I
could see where I might make the riffle,&rdquo; he
went on to say, disconsolately, &ldquo;but with only
ten or twelve feet to depend on, it looks mighty
slim.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>Crawling along the ledge, he tried to discover
more hopeful signs from other vantage
points, but with little success. A weak boy
would have given it up then and there, and
crouching on the shelf waited for some one
whose attention he could attract, to come along
the road far below. Apparently, young Merrivale
was not built that way. The stubborn
streak was in evidence as shown by his continued
activity. He was positively determined
to take great chances, if only he could discover
the spot where a promising start might
be made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to be careful,&rdquo; he told himself
several times, &ldquo;because once I break away
from up here there&rsquo;s no coming back again.
And it strikes me I&rsquo;d feel like a fly on a window
pane if I was flattened out against that
rock down there, and no chance to go up or
down. Ugh! this ledge is better than nothing
at all. And if I made a miss, there&rsquo;d be a heap
of work for old Doctor Kane of Oakvale. So
perhaps I ought to go slow, and not jump from
the frying pan into the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After all, it was the thought of those two
grinning men riding away in his hill-climbing
car that jarred him most of all. Every time he
pictured them sitting there in his seat and enjoying
themselves so hugely, Gus would make
a wry face and say something under his breath.
Accustomed to having his own way pretty
much all of the time, he chafed under the
restraint much more than most boys would
have done.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll follow them if I get out of this scrape&mdash;yes,
to the end of the world, to get that car
back again, and the money, too, if they haven&rsquo;t
spent it. I&rsquo;ll never give it up, any more than
they say the hungry wolf does once he strikes
the trail of a stag in the snow. But somehow,
I hate to climb over the edge of this
little shelf and take the count. If only somebody
would show up down there on the road,
and give me a helping hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat and looked as far as he could see
the road between the trees and bushes that encompassed
its borders, but there did not seem
to be as much as a rabbit or a hedgehog moving
down there. A shadow flitted past and
caused Gus to raise his eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! that&rsquo;s an eagle, and a whipping big
one at that!&rdquo; he remarked as he saw a large
bird swooping past, and heard a hoarse scream
at the same time. &ldquo;Oh! how easy he cuts
through the air with those powerful wings of
his. What wouldn&rsquo;t I give right now to be
able to fly like that! Why, I&rsquo;d be out of this
nasty scrape in a jiffy! And say, wouldn&rsquo;t I
overtake those fellows in a hustle, though?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just the bare thought gave him some satisfaction,
and he smiled. It was the first time
he had done anything but frown since the man
beckoned to him to pull up at the fallen sapling
laid across the narrow road.</p>
<p>His examination of the precipice had convinced
Gus that, if he attempted anything at
all, it would have to be through making use of
his short rope to lower himself to the first
crevice below. Here, if he could only manage
to secure a slender hold for his feet, he might
drag the doubled rope down and try again.
The question was could this be done? If the
task proved harder than he expected, his condition
instead of improving would have become
precarious.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>He drew a long breath and tried to make up
his mind. It was a struggle between his urgent
desire for action, and the good sense that
told him he would be foolish to undertake so
terrible a risk.</p>
<p>Twice he started to let the rope trail over the
edge of the rocky shelf; and then slowly he
drew it up again as he found that it would not
reach the first crevice unless let out at full
length. And if he fastened it above in any
way, it would be impossible to count on the
rope for further work, so that he dared not
venture to burn his bridges behind him.</p>
<p>As the minutes passed, he racked his brain
trying to think up some clever method of overcoming
the mountainous difficulties that stood
in his way. The winding road looked further
off than ever, in the simmering heat of the
early afternoon. Never in all his life had Gus
Merrivale wished for anything so much as
that some one might show up down there,
some one to whom he could make signals for
help. Minute followed minute, without a
break in the monotony.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;Seems like I&rsquo;ve just <i>got</i> to choose between
one of two things,&rdquo; he finally declared with a
ring of resolution in his voice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s plain that
I must stay on the ledge and wait and wait
ever so long, or else climb over and try to
skip down, hanging by my fingers and toes.
I wish I could see ahead a little. It makes me
dizzy to look down there and see what a pile
of rocks I&rsquo;d land on if I lost my hold. But
I haven&rsquo;t gone as far along the shelf over to
the right as I might. Perhaps there&rsquo;s a chance
for me in that direction. Anyhow I&rsquo;m going
to crawl along and find out how things lie yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On hands and knees, the boy made slow
progress, for the ledge kept getting narrower
the further he proceeded. He knew that he
must not continue until it would be a difficult
job for him to turn around when he wished to
retreat. Yet there was always the spur of
hope goading him to keep creeping just a little
further. He fancied that the surface of
the precipice was not quite as smooth over
this way, and had almost made up his mind
that if he did attempt the risky descent it must
be in this quarter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>Then that shadow flickered past him again.
Of course, it was the eagle winging its way
through space. Gus fancied that the great
bird must have become curious about his presence
there. Perhaps it had a nest back of
some crag not far away, and might take a notion
that this cliff climber was a venturesome
egg hunter trying to rob its mate of the contents
of his retreat.</p>
<p>This thought caused Gus to bring his forward
progress to a sudden halt. He even
turned his head to see what the eagle might
be up to, and counted himself fortunate in so
doing, for it gave him a chance to drop flat
on his face, and thus escape being struck by
the swooping bird.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here, get out, hang you!&rdquo; shouted the now
alarmed boy as he realized that in some way
his actions were extremely objectionable to
the eagle, which had started to make war upon
him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool! I&rsquo;m not after your
nest this trip. Why, I wouldn&rsquo;t give a snap
for all the eagle&rsquo;s eggs this side&mdash;whew! there
he comes at me again. Seems like my troubles
have only begun. And this ledge is mighty
narrow over here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he flattened himself out, and only in
time to miss connection with the passing bird.
He could feel the wind made by those broad
pinions as they swept through space just above
him, and he shuddered to imagine what was
likely to happen should he be struck fairly and
squarely by such a heavy object.</p>
<p>The boy no longer thought of pushing on.
His one desire now was to crawl back and
reach a spot where the ledge, being wider, offered
him better opportunities for defending
himself, should the angry eagle persist in his
attack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>Three other times did he have to duck and
narrowly escape disaster before he arrived at
the spot where his rope lay. An idea had come
into his head, of which he hastened to avail
himself. Quickly clutching the rope, he passed
it around his body and then managed to slip
a fold over a friendly knob of stone that projected
from the hard face of the wall back of
him.</p>
<p>In this way he fancied that he had insured
himself against a sudden shove into space,
should the eagle manage to strike him with its
wing in swooping past. He also picked up a
loose rock which he meant to use as a means
of defense. If, by some lucky blow, he could
disable that great bird, it would be to his advantage.</p>
<p>The next time an attack came, the boy struck
out, for the first time taking the aggressive.
He felt a shock that almost knocked all the
breath from his body; but it gave him a keen
sense of satisfaction to know that he had returned
the blow of the eagle after a fashion,
though his shoulder where that powerful pinion
had struck home ached as though it had
been broken.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>How long could he hold out against the furious
bird that was rapidly losing all sense of
caution? Gus must have been a sight to have
made his mother almost faint, could she have
seen him. His nose had stopped bleeding, but
there were gory marks in evidence all over his
face. His cheek was more or less puffed up
as the result of a glancing blow from the wing
of the eagle at the time its full force descended
upon his shoulder. Still, he was game to the
core. With teeth tightly clenched and eyes
blazing with excitement, he crouched there
awaiting the next move of the attacking bird
of prey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got the hang of things that time,&rdquo; he said
to himself, though even the sound of his own
voice gave him a little encouragement, &ldquo;and I
know how to hit out better after this. Just
come on and try it again, you crazy thing, and
see what you get, that&rsquo;s all! Two can play at
the give and take game, you&rsquo;ll find. Here&rsquo;s a
bigger rock I&rsquo;m going to use, and look out for
yourself, old fellow!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>Despite his brave words, the cowering lad
watched the evolutions of the monarch of the
air with a sense of deep anxiety. He inwardly
hoped and prayed that the eagle might determine
it had had enough of the fight, and fly
away. In fact, Gus was more than willing to
call it a draw, so that he might be let alone to
grapple with his other troubles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure believe he&rsquo;s going to swing in at me
again!&rdquo; muttered the lad, noticing the suggestive
actions of the great bird.</p>
<p>He was not kept in doubt long for the eagle
once more headed straight toward the spot
where Gus crouched awaiting the attack. Gus
drew in a full breath, and with every nerve
strained to the utmost tension, raised the hand
that gripped the rock, striving thus to protect
his head against the stroke of that terrible
pinion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="small">SCOUTS TO THE RESCUE.</span></h2>
<p>When the collision came, the boy uttered a
shout that was a curious commingling of pain
and exultation. His arm and hand felt as
though they had been given a severe galvanic
shock, but he was conscious of the pleasing
fact that he must have struck the eagle a hard
blow with the rock, which had been knocked
from his grasp and gone over the edge of the
shelf, rattling down along the face of the precipice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where did he go to?&rdquo; stammered the boy,
beginning to recover from the concussion, and
casting about for another weapon in the shape
of a fragment of granite. &ldquo;Oh! there he is
perched on that spur down below. And see
how his wing hangs, will you? Perhaps it&rsquo;s
broken, for it struck my stone like a pile driver.
Don&rsquo;t I hope that&rsquo;s a fact, though! I warned
him he&rsquo;d get the worst of the bargain if he
kept on fooling with me. Serves the old pirate
right. But now I&rsquo;m worse off than ever, because
with this lame shoulder I wouldn&rsquo;t dare
take the risk of hanging to a rope and flattening
out against the face of the precipice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He kept rubbing his lame shoulder while
talking. The immediate future did not look
very promising. How much time had elapsed
while he had been there in his predicament,
Gus could not say, but no doubt it seemed many
times longer in his mind than was actually the
case.</p>
<p>Not being a scout, he had never learned how
to tell time from the position of the sun, moon
or stars, so that he could only give a rough
guess as to how much of the summer afternoon
had slipped away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>And now, new sources of dread began to
assail him. The sun had crept around so that
its scorching rays fell full upon the face of the
cliff above, and this aroused Gus to the fact
that he was beginning to get exceedingly
thirsty. Once he allowed himself to think of
this, he imagined that his tongue was trying
to cling to the roof of his mouth for lack of a
drink. Yes, and he even remembered reading
a short time before of the terrible sufferings
a boat load of shipwrecked people endured
while adrift on the heaving ocean.</p>
<p>Supposing that no one appeared on the road
below during the whole afternoon, how was
he going to pass the coming night? He would
not dare go to sleep for fear that he might roll
from his insecure lodgment, unless he took the
precaution to fasten himself with the friendly
rope, which he was beginning to look upon
as his most valued possession.</p>
<p>More time elapsed, during which Gus was
recovering in some degree from the fatigue
following his desperate battle with the eagle.
He could still see the big bird perched on that
lower crag, and he noticed, not without more
or less savage satisfaction, that it seemed to
be preening its feathers, paying particular attention
to the drooping wing which had come
in contact with the rock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;For two cents, I&rsquo;d start bombarding you,
and see if you could fly,&rdquo; he told the bird, as
he shook his fist in that quarter, &ldquo;but I suppose
that would be a silly move, because if it
turned out that the wing wasn&rsquo;t broken after
all, you might take a notion to start at me
again. So I guess I&rsquo;ll call it off, and try to
forget all I owe you, old chap. Hello! what&rsquo;s
that I hear? Sounds as if a machine of some
kind might be coming away off yonder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He strained his ear to better catch the
sounds. As the fickle breeze came and went,
he managed to make out that the queer rattle
kept getting distincter each moment. This
would indicate that whatever was giving
vent to the sounds must be approaching, and
not going the other way.</p>
<p>The boy prisoner on the rocky ledge began
to thrill with excitement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;But really, I never heard a car act like
that,&rdquo; he muttered as he heard the peculiar
throbbing again welling up from below. &ldquo;It
might be the exhaust of a motorboat or of a
motorcycle, only&mdash;oh! there <i>were</i> three of them
at the inn. Yes, it must be those scouts heading
up this way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first, the very thought of possibly owing
his rescue to Hugh Hardin and his two chums
of the saddle, gave Gus a feeling of chagrin.
If he had his choice, very naturally he would
have much preferred that some stranger pull
him up from the predicament in which a cruel
fortune had thrust him. But then, after all
he had gone through, the boy&rsquo;s pride had been
sadly battered, and he did not feel like looking
a gift horse in the mouth. So long as he
escaped from this miserable trap, he felt that
he would be foolish to draw distinctions. Besides,
somehow he did not seem to feel <i>quite</i>
the same way toward the scouts as before.
When worn by those who were in a position
to do him a great favor, those jeered-at khaki
uniforms might look even friendly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>And so, Gus Merrivale kept tabs on the
dusty road far below, eagerly waiting to catch
the first glimpse of the coming party.</p>
<p>As he looked, he suddenly saw a swiftly
moving object appear around a bend in the
road, the sun&rsquo;s rays glinting from polished steel
and nickeled parts. It was one of the trio of
scouts on his motorcycle, and heading directly
toward the base of the cliff!</p>
<p>Filled with excitement, Gus made a megaphone
out of both hands by cupping them,
and shouted at the top of his lusty voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! hello! Help! help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was pleased to see that the rider of the
flashing wheel must have heard his loud call
by the way he turned his head upward. Gus
immediately started waving his handkerchief,
somewhat after the fashion he remembered
seeing a scout do with his signal flag, and
which, at the time, he had only thought was a
silly procedure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;He sees me! He lifted his hand and
waved it!&rdquo; the prisoner of the ledge exclaimed,
thrilled with delight. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be all
right after all! If only I can make them
understand that they&rsquo;ve got to get above so
as to pull me up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By now he had discovered a second and then
a third speeding motor flash around the curve.
Undoubtedly, the pacemaker must have made
some prearranged signal, for the others immediately
cut down their speed, and a minute
later jumped from their saddles at the spot
where the first rider had dismounted.</p>
<p>He was pointing upward toward the ledge,
and the eager Gus was able to catch a few
words that came trailing through space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened to you?&rdquo; Hugh Hardin
was shouting, also making use of his hands in
order to help his voice along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On a ledge&mdash;can&rsquo;t get up or down&mdash;follow
the road to log rail, and get me out of this&mdash;Gusty
Merrivale&mdash;been stopped on the road
and robbed!&rdquo; was what the one above shouted
down to them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>No doubt his words created something of a
sensation, for he could see the three scouts putting
their heads close together as though conferring.
Then once more Hugh, who was
looked upon as the leader by his comrades,
called out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right&mdash;hold the fort a little while longer&mdash;we&rsquo;re
coming up as fast as we can get there&mdash;take
things easy&mdash;we&rsquo;ll sure yank you up
off that ledge&mdash;so-long!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without wasting another minute, the
speaker was seen to straddle his machine and
start off, the others following his example
shortly afterward.</p>
<p>With a warmer feeling in his heart toward
the scouts than he had ever known before, Gus
watched them shooting toward the foot of the
rise. Now and then he would lose sight of
this rider or that one, and for several minutes
he could only trace their progress by the dust
that arose. Then the last fellow had vanished
from view. He knew from the sounds that
came occasionally to his ears that they were
climbing the ascent which had tried his little
runabout&rsquo;s powers to the utmost.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>It seemed a terribly long wait to the impatient
boy. He tried to pass the time away
by picturing to himself how he would immediately
start off after those bold hoboes who
had held him up on the road, evidently knowing
that he was due with the money to settle
with the quarry workers on the semimonthly
pay day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, down there, Gusty! We&rsquo;re here on
deck, and ready to give you a helping hand!&rdquo;
called out a voice from directly above. The
boy, aroused from his train of thought, looking
directly up, saw a friendly face, which he
immediately recognized as belonging to Hugh
Hardin, the leader of the Wolf Patrol.</p>
<p>Immediately another countenance appeared
alongside, this time being the rosy one of
Billy Worth, nor was the third scout long in
showing up near by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you get me up there?&rdquo; asked Gus
anxiously. Now that another crisis in his
affairs had arrived, he began to feel dubious
again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to figure it out,&rdquo; the other replied.
&ldquo;If it comes to the worst, we can use
a sapling that I noticed lying alongside the
road below here, and have you climb up that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! that same sapling has already played
a part in my troubles!&rdquo; exclaimed the boy below,
with something like a smile, &ldquo;and perhaps
it would be only evening it up if you used it
to get me out of here. But I&rsquo;ve got a mighty
lame shoulder, you see. I had a fight with
that eagle over there on that stone cap, and I
reckon I nearly broke his wing, but first he
gave me some ugly clips. Why, I had to tie
myself to the rock with this piece of rope so
I wouldn&rsquo;t be knocked off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you say a rope?&rdquo; quickly asked the
scout leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, this short piece that the men lowered
me down here with, and then threw after me,
knowing that I couldn&rsquo;t use it to get any further
down the precipice,&rdquo; and the boy on the
shelf held it up as he spoke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! that makes it as easy as falling off a
log,&rdquo; came from Hugh cheerfully. &ldquo;All you
have to do is to fix the loop under your arms,
and when I lower a cord, tie it to the other
end of your rope. Then we&rsquo;ll get hold of it,
and up you come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds good to me!&rdquo; declared Gus,
already warming toward the boy who it seemed
was fated to become his rescuer.</p>
<p>A minute later and the dangling cord came
within his reach, and as he had already made
the noose secure around his body, Gus hastened
to tie this to the end of his rope. He
saw it mount speedily upward, and presently
a shout from Billy announced that the rope
had come into their hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All ready there?&rdquo; demanded the patrol
leader. &ldquo;Dead sure the loop will hold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It did when they let me down,&rdquo; replied
Gus with the utmost confidence. &ldquo;Please hurry
up and begin. And be sure not to slip, because
it&rsquo;s pretty far down to the bottom. A fellow
wouldn&rsquo;t know what hit him if he took that
drop.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about us!&rdquo; said Billy Worth.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve practiced this same thing many a time
just for fun. You never can tell when it pays
to know how to get a fellow out of a hole.
Scouts learn all kinds of clever stunts, you
know, Gusty. This one is going to help you
a heap, seems like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Right then and there Gus Merrivale realized
that he had been judging these boys from the
wrong standpoint. Really, he had refused to
give them credit for being other than a lot of
silly chaps who wasted their time in camping
out, and learning things that could never be
of any earthly good to anyone. After this
he was bound to look deeper into the movement.
And his heart warmed toward Hugh
and his chums in a way he would have never
believed possible a few hours before.</p>
<p>The rope grew taut, and then he felt himself
being lifted from the ledge, and steadily raised
foot by foot. Presently he could reach up and
catch hold of the lowermost log that served as
a barrier alongside the mountain road to prevent
accidents to vehicles coming down the grade.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>It was with a thankfulness he could hardly
find words to express that the boy was assisted
over the railing, and found his feet firmly
planted on the roadway. He drew a long
breath of relief, possibly the very first that
he had dared indulge in since being held up
by those two brazen rogues. And then, urged
by some better element in his nature, Gusty
Merrivale grasped the hand of the patrol leader
and squeezed it in his own, passing from Hugh
to each of the other scouts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V.
<br /><span class="small">SEEING THINGS IN A NEW LIGHT.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Now tell us what happened to you. We&rsquo;re
all wired up about it,&rdquo; said Billy Worth when
Gus had gone the rounds and shaken each of
his rescuers most cordially by the hand, as
though he meant them to feel that his gratitude
was sincere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you said something that sounded like
robbed, and we&rsquo;ve been trying to figure out
what it meant ever since,&rdquo; added Monkey
Stallings, who was really a late addition to the
troop, though making his way up the ladder
by leaps and bounds, being a lad eager to
learn all the things of which a first-class scout
must have a knowledge in order to obtain his
badge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; began Gusty with a whimsical grin,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s just this way. I&rsquo;ve been sent up here several
times twice a month to carry the money
used to pay the hundred Italians and other
foreigners working in our granite quarries.
I guess somebody must have spotted me this
time. Two men, who looked like tramps but
who may have been worse than that, lay in
wait for me just below here. They had that
sapling fixed so that it crossed the road, and I
couldn&rsquo;t have got past even if I tried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! what d&rsquo;ye think of that! And right
here within twenty miles of Oakvale, too?&rdquo;
ejaculated Billy, his face expressing the most
intense interest, &ldquo;but excuse my interrupting
you, Gusty. Please go on. You&rsquo;ve got me
chained fast. Stopped you on the road did
they, and robbed you of the pay money?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;When I managed to pull up, I was right on
the tree they had thrown across the road,&rdquo;
continued the other. &ldquo;At first the tall man pretended
he was a country constable, meaning
to arrest me because I was speeding,
though of course, it was silly to think of such
a thing away up here in the mountains. Then
the other fellow showed up, and they let me
know that they&rsquo;d been waiting for me in order
to steal the money I carried. I tried to jump
into the runabout again to get hold of the
gun dad makes me carry, but they battered
me on the head, and nearly did me as you can
see. In the end they lowered me to that ledge,
so that I couldn&rsquo;t get anywhere and give the
alarm. Oh! I&rsquo;ve been having the time of my
life, let me tell you! But if they think they&rsquo;re
going to get away with this job so easy, they&rsquo;re
barking up the wrong tree. Now I&rsquo;m out of
that hole, I mean to get after them lickety-split.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much of a start have they got?&rdquo; asked
Hugh soberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really I couldn&rsquo;t tell you,&rdquo; came the reply.
&ldquo;You see, that short rascal snatched my gold
watch before they lowered me down the precipice.
It seemed to me as if I must have been
there for hours.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was just a little more than an hour and a
half ago that you left the tavern where we
were waiting to be called to dinner,&rdquo; Hugh told
him. Gus expressed the greatest surprise, for
he had never known time to drag so before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But let&rsquo;s talk of what can be done to overtake
those men and get back all they took
from me,&rdquo; he suggested doggedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of us might turn around and make a
run for home to get the police on the track,&rdquo;
ventured Billy, &ldquo;though it would be taking big
chances to start me over that course, because
I&rsquo;m a bum rider so far, and apt to take a
header if I get a little rattled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far away are the quarries you were
making for, Gus?&rdquo; asked Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, something like ten miles, I should say,&rdquo;
came the reply. &ldquo;Too far to go for help. Besides,
what good would a dozen or two of
those wild Italian laborers be in a thief chase?
Chances are the men would make a clean getaway.
No, something else will have to be tried
if we hope to bring them up with a round
turn.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s to hinder the lot of us whooping
after them, and finding some chance either to
have them arrested, or perhaps do the job as
slick as you please, while they sleep?&rdquo; demanded
Monkey Stallings, who came by his
name through his faculty for doings all sorts
of antics, from climbing greased poles that no
other boy could mount, to hanging from lofty
limbs of trees by his toes, and pretending to
sleep that way, just as though he were a
simian in truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you only would, it might turn out to be
the grandest thing ever!&rdquo; exclaimed the Merrivale
boy, his face lighting up with sudden hope
as he contemplated the shining motorcycles
nearby, and remembered what wonderful
things they were capable of accomplishing in
the right hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>&ldquo;You see, we were making our way up to a
camp where a few of our fellow scouts have
been spending a week,&rdquo; Hugh explained. &ldquo;We
declined to go along because we expected these
machines to arrive, and were all fairly wild
to get busy with them. And between ourselves
we had secretly arranged to give the boys a
big surprise after all of us got so we could
ride fairly well. But you must know that it
is a part of a scout&rsquo;s education to give up his
own pleasure whenever he can help anyone
who is in trouble; and so, Gus, we will do
what we can to assist you to recover your
runabout, as well as the money they took from
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine of you, Hugh!&rdquo; declared the
other boy, flushing with pleasure, as well as
with shame at the recollection of how he had
misjudged these splendid fellows in the past.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to get my eyes opened to a
lot of things about this scout business, and if
only you can help me out, I reckon I&rsquo;ll just
have to join the troop, no matter if I start
in as the worst tenderfoot you ever saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bully for you, Gusty!&rdquo; cried the explosive
Billy. &ldquo;Take my word for it, you&rsquo;ll never have
any reason to regret the step if you do hitch
up with the scouts. Fact is you&rsquo;ll wonder how
you ever got any fun in life before you knocked
the scales off your eyes, and saw things everywhere
around you. We know. Lots of us have
been through the mill, haven&rsquo;t we, Monkey?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>&ldquo;We sure have, Billy,&rdquo; answered the other
solemnly, &ldquo;and nothing could hire me to throw
up my present job of gymnastic teacher to the
troop. As to learning things, I&rsquo;ve found out
how to stow away a quarter more rations every
meal by just watching you work your jaws,
Billy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can follow after the runabout without
much trouble once we examine the marks made
by its tires in some muddy spot,&rdquo; Hugh said,
speaking directly to the boy who had been
taken from the ledge, &ldquo;because in nearly every
case you&rsquo;ll find there&rsquo;s a distinctive mark about
the track left by a rubber-shod wheel. I can
tell the trail my motorcycle makes among a
dozen; both the others have individualities
about them that all of us have learned to recognize.
And I expect you may have noticed
something about the marks your car leaves that
would tell you which road it took, in case we
came to a fork?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t think I ever took the trouble
to notice anything like that,&rdquo; Gus confessed
not without more or less confusion, as though
he might already be beginning to realize how
lacking in practical information his education
was, &ldquo;but now that you speak of it, there was
a patch put on one of the rear tires that I
should think would leave an impression something
like a diamond. Of course, though, that
wouldn&rsquo;t show here where the road is rocky;
but at the first chance we could watch out for
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh looked at him with a half smile on
his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talk as though you expected to go
along with us, Gusty?&rdquo; he observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to tell the truth I&rsquo;m hoping you&rsquo;ll ask
me to hang on behind,&rdquo; the other instantly
replied. &ldquo;You see, I&rsquo;ve ridden a motorcycle
before and I guess my shoulder isn&rsquo;t so
lame but what I could keep my seat. Those
men treated me about as mean as they knew
how, and I&rsquo;ve been telling myself all along that,
if only I could have a hand in their apprehension,
it&rsquo;d go a great way to evening things up.
Do you reckon now, Hugh, that if you took
me on behind it would go?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>His whole manner was so imploring that
even had the patrol leader felt inclined to hesitate
he must have found it very difficult to
disappoint Gusty. It chanced, however, that
Hugh knew more about a motorcycle than
either of his chums, or both together for that
matter. And he believed that if the other boy
had the nerve to keep his seat he could take
him along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing to make the try, anyhow,
Gusty,&rdquo; was what Hugh told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! thank you, thank you a dozen times,
for you&rsquo;ve made me feel ever so happy!&rdquo; cried
the Merrivale boy. Apparently he had made
a clean sweep when he threw that pride of his
overboard, for once again he reached out and
shook the hand of Hugh, as though determined
to look on him as his best friend. &ldquo;And
there&rsquo;s one other thing you ought to know,
because it may cut some figure in the chase.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;What might that be?&rdquo; asked Billy, evidently
more or less relieved to know the patrol
leader would not be wanting him to head back
over their trail so as to carry the startling news
of the hold-up to the authorities in distant
Oakvale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only took on five gallons of juice at the
inn, you see,&rdquo; continued Gusty, eager to advance
any item, however small, that might
have a bearing on the successful pursuit of
the two bad men, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t believe there
could have been much aboard at the time,
either. So they couldn&rsquo;t run more than twenty
miles before it would give out. If they fail
to take on a new stock, perhaps we might find
my runabout abandoned on the road somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;Either that, or wrecked,&rdquo; suggested Monkey,
&ldquo;because every fellow who thinks he can
run a car doesn&rsquo;t succeed. I know, because it
cost an uncle of mine a pile of hard cash to
get his machine saved from the scrap heap
after I&rsquo;d turned over at the foot of a little
hill where there was a sharp curve and lots of
loose sand. See that scar under my hair&mdash;that
makes me think of how hard a car can
kick, every time I look at it when I&rsquo;m brushing
my locks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we mean to start this chase, we&rsquo;d better
be making a move,&rdquo; Billy advised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The crown of the hill seems to be just a
little way off,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;and so I think
we ought to push our machines up the rest of
the way, and mount for a coast down the
grade. Once we reach the bottom where
there&rsquo;s a chance to find some moist clay, we&rsquo;ll
try scout tactics, and get a clew about that
mended tire you spoke of, Gusty. Come on,
boys!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you fellows I&rsquo;m feeling two hundred
per cent. better already,&rdquo; announced the boy
who had been rescued from the ledge over the
brow of the precipice. &ldquo;If only we could lay
those ugly scoundrels by the heels, I&rsquo;d call it
a thousand per cent. Your talking about
tracking them by following the clew of my
mended tire makes me see how much I&rsquo;ve been
missing all this while by thinking scouts were
a foolish bunch of crack-brained boys, running
after a leader like sheep after the bell wether.
I guess I&rsquo;m the chump after all who has allowed
his prejudice to run away with his common
sense. That&rsquo;s all in the past, let me tell
you. I&rsquo;m beginning to see a great light, and
this experience is going to change a lot of the
ideas I&rsquo;ve been hanging on to, believe me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While talking in this strain, the four boys
were pushing up the rise. Just as the patrol
leader had remarked, the crown of the hill
was in plain sight only a little distance beyond
where Gusty had met with his strange adventure
and passed through an experience he
would not be likely to forget soon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>Under ordinary conditions Gusty might possibly
have consented to adopt a sling for his
bruised arm, and even walk around for a day
or two while playing the part of martyr, but
there was no time for such nonsense. The
prospect of overtaking the two thieves, and
at least making some sort of effort to recover
what they had stolen, gave him unexpected
strength to endure the pain without even a
grimace. Why, he stood ready to grit his
teeth, and make light of worse conditions than
this while the hope of turning the tables on
those hoboes continued to brighten!</p>
<p>When the boys arrived at the brow of the
hill, they could see how the road was beginning
to dip. Hugh asked a few questions of Gusty,
who had been over it a number of times before,
and was therefore competent to give advice.
He wished to make sure that no sudden bend
would crop out to serve as a trap for inexperienced
riders. When this point had been settled,
Hugh had the fourth boy mount behind
him, clasp his arms around his waist, and then
the descent of the hill was begun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI.
<br /><span class="small">TRACKING FROM THE SADDLE.</span></h2>
<p>Hugh Hardin was accustomed to serving as
pacemaker. Besides being leader of the Wolf
Patrol, to which Billy also belonged, he had
long ago been elected assistant scout master to
the troop. When Lieutenant Denmead, a retired
army officer who had taken great interest
in the boys of the town, could not be present,
Hugh served in his stead. Being a first-class
scout, he had found no difficulty in securing
his credentials to act in this important capacity
from Boy Scout Headquarters off in New
York City.</p>
<p>Consequently, when he led the procession of
saddle boys down the slope of the ridge, he
felt quite at home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>There was no attempt to make great speed.
This would have been looked upon as the essence
of folly on several accounts. In the first
place there was good-natured Billy Worth
who, being a novice with the motorcycle, was
apt to get himself into trouble at any moment.
Then they must remember that they were
really tracking the two hoboes who had stolen
the runabout as well as relieved Gusty Merrivale
of the pay roll, which the Italian laborers
up in his father&rsquo;s quarries were anxiously expecting.
And if these two reasons were not
enough, there was the fact that the pacemaker
was carrying double on his machine, which
made things just a bit unwieldy.</p>
<p>Of course, there would be stretches along
the road where they might reasonably expect
to &ldquo;hit her up,&rdquo; as Billy was wont to say.
These would occur where the ground happened
to be fairly level, or slightly up-grade.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>Nothing happened up to the time the boys
arrived at the foot of the mountain. Hugh
had not forgotten what he had said about taking
a good look at the marks left by the tires
of the runabout. He was desirous of seeing
for himself what that diamond-shaped patch,
mentioned by Gusty, would look like when reproduced
in the soft soil at some point where
moisture chanced to lie upon a low portion of
the road, as, for instance, in the vicinity of
some creek.</p>
<p>The opportunity came much sooner than
he had hoped would be the case. There, a
little way ahead, Hugh discovered that the road
crossed some depression by means of a bridge.
This would indicate the presence of a small
stream, perhaps a mere thread of water in
midsummer, but capable of becoming a boiling
torrent when the Spring rains were on.</p>
<p>He immediately threw up his hand several
times in a suggestive way, which was a part
of the code of signals understood by both his
chums. It meant that he intended slowing
up, and possibly stopping short. Motorcycle
riders as a rule go at such a pace that they
seldom travel any other way than tandem;
and it is expected of each fellow to keep a
wary eye from time to time on the one ahead
of him so as to discover any sign, which he is
expected to pass on down the line. In this way
accidents due to speed are usually avoided.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>A minute later both the other boys had come
to a halt. Leaving their machines alongside
the road, they hurried to where both Hugh and
Gusty were stooping down searching for a
positive imprint of the mended tire of the
runabout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a good impression,&rdquo; remarked Monkey
Stallings as soon as he arrived. He had
the quickest eyes in the whole troop, and
seemed able to discover things that it would
have taken Billy many times as long to unearth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t be better,&rdquo; observed Hugh, hurrying
to his side, &ldquo;and, as usual, you&rsquo;ve beaten us
all out again, Monkey. How about this,
Gusty? We&rsquo;re looking at the sign of the patch,
of course?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;That was what I meant,&rdquo; replied the other.
&ldquo;But, honest now, this is the first time I&rsquo;ve so
much as noticed what sort of a mark my old
tire makes. I knew about the way the repair-shop
man mended it, and that was all. Think
we can recognize it if we see it again, do you,
Hugh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even Billy snorted at that, as he quickly exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you knew more about how scouts are
trained to use their eyes, ears, and ditto, their
thinking boxes, you wouldn&rsquo;t ask that, my
friend. Why, one of the first of experiments
a tenderfoot has to pass through, is to take a
quick look in at a store window where scores
of different things are on exhibition, go away
and immediately write down all he can remember.
The more exact he gets the higher his
score. That influences him to begin to exercise
his memory. It&rsquo;s queer how a fellow can
increase his powers that way. Why, my capacity
has fairly doubled since I joined the
scouts, and I surprise my folks every day by
remembering things they promised to get for
me away back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monkey Stallings grinned as he caught
Billy&rsquo;s eye, and quietly observed:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m real glad to hear that, Billy, because
there&rsquo;s some chance that you&rsquo;ll even remember
that quarter you borrowed from me
&lsquo;away back&rsquo; when we were on the train coming
home from our trip with the Naval Reserve.
I&rsquo;d clean given up hope; but I know it&rsquo;s all
right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a good squint at this mark, everybody,&rdquo;
said Hugh, pointing down to where
the wheel which had the mended tire had
passed through a yard or two of clay, making
a splendid impression. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll want to look
for it plenty of times as we go along, you
understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When all of them announced that they had
it engraved indelibly on their mind&rsquo;s eye, Hugh
once more started off along the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep tabs on the right,&rdquo; he had told
Billy and Monkey before he left them, &ldquo;while
you two watch the other side of the road for
any sign telling that the men turned in.
There&rsquo;s no saying what trick they may be up
to, and we don&rsquo;t want to go speeding along on
a fool&rsquo;s errand. Get that, both of you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure we do, Hugh,&rdquo; Billy replied.
&ldquo;Chances are they mean to cover a good many
miles before they abandon the motor car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gusty was in a position to speak whenever
the spirit moved him, as his head came close
to that of the one who sat in the saddle. They
were as a rule going at quite a smart pace, and
the dust was apt to get in his mouth whenever
he opened it, so that he did not indulge in much
useless talking.</p>
<p>Now and then, however, he would make
some pertinent remark. This was usually in
connection with the character of the road, or
else had reference to the fact that a short distance
ahead lay a hamlet which he remembered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a road branches off from this one,
too,&rdquo; he went on to say, after giving this information,
&ldquo;and once I ran over it, having been
told that while it didn&rsquo;t pass through the little
village it had a smoother surface. And my
information was correct to the dot, because it
joined this road further on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>&ldquo;If those men know the country as well as I
think they do,&rdquo; Hugh turned partly in his saddle
to say, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll as like as not take that
same road, because it seems that after committing
so daring a robbery they&rsquo;ll want to
keep out of sight as much as they can. Yes,
I can see where the fork lies ahead,&rdquo; and with
that he held out his hand as a sign to the next
in line, who happened to be Billy this time.</p>
<p>It proved that Hugh&rsquo;s prediction was correct,
for the runabout had certainly started
into the other road. This would indicate that
the pair of precious rascals must be pretty
well acquainted with the section of country.
It afterward turned out that the taller fellow
had been raised not many miles away from the
village which was being left in the rear. Perhaps
he feared that some one might happen to
recognize him if he went through the place,
for some of these countrymen have long memories.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>Further on they again came back to the road
that led to the quarries. A mile or so beyond
the junction, however, another turn was made.
After that Gusty could not venture to give the
least information, because they were now covering
ground that was entirely new to him.</p>
<p>Hugh had already made up his mind on one
score. This was to the effect that those whom
they were pursuing must be heading for some
place which they had knowledge of, and where
they believed they would be fairly safe from
discovery.</p>
<p>As the boys proceeded steadily along, the
pacemaker became aware of another fact that
began to give him increasing satisfaction. He
and his two chums had been heading for
the distant spot where some of their fellow
scouts were in camp on an island in the river.
These other boys had come a long way by
means of a motorboat loaned to them by an
enthusiastic gentleman of the home town, who,
being abroad for the summer, desired to show
his appreciation for the manly conduct of the
scouts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>Hugh had a map of the country with him.
He had never been over some sections of it,
but, having made a study of topography, he
believed that they were by degrees drawing
nearer to the river, and would, if they kept on,
strike it not far away from Raccoon Island,
where Don Miller, leader of the Fox Patrol,
had the boys in charge in the absence of others
in authority.</p>
<p>When they made a brief halt in order to
slake their thirst at a gurgling spring that
gushed up alongside the road, Hugh put his
comrades in possession of this astonishing bit
of information. Naturally they were greatly
pleased, especially Billy, whose merry face
glowed with a sudden inspiring thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whee! talk to me about the luck of the
Wolf Patrol!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this just
like the old story? Now, chances are those
hobo footpads&rsquo;ll go into hiding in the woods
not three miles away from the island camp.
What&rsquo;s the answer? Why, we&rsquo;ll send a signal
to the boys that they&rsquo;re wanted, and pretty
soon one by one they&rsquo;ll line up till we&rsquo;ll be a
baker&rsquo;s dozen all told. I&rsquo;m sorry for the poor
wretches that took your runabout when that
comes about, Gusty. You&rsquo;ll get your first lesson
on what it means to be a scout, when you
see how we work this deal. Since Ralph Kenyon
joined the troop, he&rsquo;s shown up a heap of
new things connected with woodcraft and the
like. Even Hugh here has admitted that the
boy who used to spend his winters trapping
wild animals for their pelts so he could lay by
a store of money to take him to the School of
Mines some day, knew more&rsquo;n he ever did.
And there&rsquo;s Arthur Cameron, Bud Morgan,
Jack Durham, Spike Welling and a lot of other
good fellows in camp up here, too. Hugh, I
only hope she turns out like you say. Are we
off again now?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and taking things fairly easy, too,&rdquo;
replied the leader as he straddled his machine,
and waited for Gusty to get in position before
starting. &ldquo;If they expect to hide somewhere
around this region, we&rsquo;ll bump in on them
soon enough. So, steady, everybody, from
now on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While at the spring, he had taken out his
road map and allowed all of them to see their
location. The river was not many miles away,
and this road crossed it by means of a bridge.
Raccoon Island lay some distance above, where
the stream widened and formed quite a shallow
lake-like lagoon with wild borders, an ideal
spot for a boys&rsquo; camp.</p>
<p>Billy managed to meet with some trifling
trouble in making his getaway. This caused
him to bring up the rear, a position he usually
occupied, by the way, in most of their trips,
for Billy was inclined to be sluggish in his
movements, though his mind was active
enough.</p>
<p>Motorcycles are splendid mounts to carry
one swiftly along over fairly decent thoroughfares,
but being more or less noisy, in spite of
all efforts to stifle the explosions by means of
the muffler, they can hardly be deemed just the
thing to use when silence is necessary.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>Hugh knew that if the men they were following
had a camp near the road they would
be apt to discover the approach of the boys
long before he and his chums could lay any
plans looking to their capture.</p>
<p>Accordingly, he had already decided in his
own mind that whenever it looked as if the
thieves were near the end of their journey,
the noisy wheels would be temporarily abandoned,
and the balance of the tracking necessary
done afoot, where their knowledge of
Indian tactics might be brought into successful
play.</p>
<p>They could not have covered more than a
mile, after leaving the cold spring at which
they had refreshed themselves, when Monkey
Stallings plainly heard a sound from the rear
that announced the coming of some sort of
trouble to the rider who brought up the tail
end of the procession. Upon which, he instantly
used his horn to let the leaders know
that another halt must be called in order to
assist Billy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII.
<br /><span class="small">THE SUNKEN ROAD.</span></h2>
<p>Hugh came running back, with Gusty trailing
after him, quite as anxious as the rest to
learn what had happened to the one bringing
up the rear of the motorcycle procession.</p>
<p>They found Billy bending down and examining
his machine with a woe-begone look on his
good-natured face. He glanced up at their
approach. Monkey Stallings was on the other
side, and still searching for the cause of the
trouble, though he did not know much more
than the stout boy about the intricate construction
of motors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ails you now, Billy?&rdquo; asked Hugh,
for he did not have to be told that the individual
in question was the cause of the breakdown.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wish I knew,&rdquo; replied the other, dolefully,
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s the trouble. You see I&rsquo;ve noticed for
some little time that I had to make more or
less of an effort to keep my place in the line.
While you fellows were gliding along as
smooth as silk, my balky engine had to be
coaxed and kicked to hold its own. And
now, after that last little halt she&rsquo;s gone back
on me altogether. I keep losing ground right
along, and would soon be hull down in the distance.
That&rsquo;s why I let out the toot for help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh looked serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means a delay while we examine things,&rdquo;
he remarked, throwing off his coat as though
getting ready for business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if I&rsquo;ve gone and blundered again,&rdquo;
Billy continued sadly. &ldquo;It would serve me just
about right if the rest of you went on and left
me to my fate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, rats, don&rsquo;t mention it,&rdquo; said Monkey
indignantly. &ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye take us for, anyway?
What&rsquo;s the use of being a scout if you
won&rsquo;t hold out a helping hand to a comrade
in distress? We&rsquo;d expect you to do the same
if one of our machines threw up the sponge,
and sulked. Leave it to Hugh; he&rsquo;ll bring you
around O. K.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>That was an old story with the boys. &ldquo;Leave
it to Hugh&rdquo; had become a sort of slogan with
the members of the Wolf Patrol. Many a time
had Billy, Bud Morgan, Arthur Cameron or
some other member of the famous patrol, after
trying in vain to solve a knotty problem, turned
hopefully to the assistant scout master; and
seldom had their sublime confidence in his
ability to find a remedy been misplaced.</p>
<p>As Hugh began to use his little monkey-wrench,
unfastening several nuts, and testing
one thing after another, the others watched
with considerable interest. Minutes crept on
until it began to look as though they had lost
nearly half an hour on the road. &ldquo;Billy Wolf,&rdquo;
as he was often called by his chums, fretted
terribly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better leave me here while the rest of you
go on,&rdquo; he said for the fourth time. He had
hardly gotten the words out of his mouth when
he heard Hugh give a little satisfied chuckle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;Located the trouble?&rdquo; asked Monkey
eagerly, with a triumphant glance toward
Gusty, as though to say: &ldquo;There! what did
I tell you; Hugh is the boss hand to see through
things, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; explained Hugh, &ldquo;it was a
mighty simple thing, but it happened that I
tried about seven other possible causes for a
gradual slowing up of the motor before I
reached the carburetor. Why, it was only the
needle valve that stuck. I&rsquo;ll have it working
as good as ever in a jiffy; and you&rsquo;ll not be
bothered again from <i>that</i> cause in a hurry,
Billy, old fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! was that it?&rdquo; remarked the relieved
Billy. &ldquo;I began to think the whole business
must be on the bum, and that I&rsquo;d have to walk
and push the plagued machine along with me
to the village three miles back. Huh! believe
me, I&rsquo;ll keep an eye on that tricky valve after
this. I may make lots of mistakes, but it&rsquo;s
seldom I tumble into the same old hole twice.
I&rsquo;m on, Hugh; I see how you do it. I&rsquo;m learning
something new every hour of the day.
Seems like there&rsquo;s an everlasting lot of things I
don&rsquo;t grasp yet. The more I know the more
I don&rsquo;t know. Laugh now, Monkey, but you&rsquo;re
in the same boat yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh made short work of his job, and presently
handed the motorcycle over to its owner.</p>
<p>On the way back to where his own machine
had been left, he was pleased to hear Gusty
remark with considerable vim, as though he
meant it:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like the way you fellows carry on, honest
I do. I&rsquo;ve been with a set that would have
left a chap in the lurch to take care of his
own wheel while they rode on and told him
they&rsquo;d wait at the next wayside inn, where they
could get a cool drink of mineral water, and
lie around resting up till he came. You scouts
stand by each other. And I understand now
why they elected you assistant scout master
of the troop. You&rsquo;re Johnny-on-the-spot for
the job, all right, Hugh Hardin. Excuse me
if I ask all sorts of foolish questions about the
way scouts manage. I&rsquo;m getting up to my ears
interested in this game. I never dreamed it
could be so fascinating. And the more you
hear, the more you want to know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the secret of the rapid growth of the
scout movement,&rdquo; Hugh told him. &ldquo;As soon
as you get the average boy interested he asks
questions, and once that happens, he learns
things that set him agoing. After that nothing
can stop him; and in a year&rsquo;s time, you
wouldn&rsquo;t know it was the same boy, because he
takes such an interest in a thousand things
that are happening all around him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon they were moving on again, and from
the signals that came from the rear, Hugh
knew that all was well with Billy.</p>
<p>Perhaps two more miles had been placed behind
them, when all of a sudden the pacemaker
gave a short blast on his horn, and
slowed up as though he had made a discovery
of some sort. Immediately he and Gusty were
off, he leaned his motorcycle up against a convenient
tree, not waiting to make use of the
stand, and leading the other through a fringe
of bushes, observed:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is that your car, Gusty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rich man&rsquo;s son gave a low cry of mingled
surprise and joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I declare if it isn&rsquo;t my runabout!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;And to think how easily you
glimpsed it ahead. But what do you expect
they drew it in here for, Hugh? Has the gas
given out, or was there a smash of some sort?
Seems to be all right, as far&rsquo;s I can see at a
glance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to figure that out in a minute
or so,&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;You keep on examining
the car while I look around to see which
way the two men went from here. That would
be apt to give us a clew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what way?&rdquo; demanded Gusty, while he
started to look his property over, in order to
learn the condition in which it had been left
by the two robbers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if they kept on along the road it
would look as if they had been unable to use
the runabout further,&rdquo; answered the patrol
leader, as he stooped and began to use his practiced
eyes to advantage. &ldquo;On the other hand,
if they plunged right into the woods I would
think they had come as far as they expected
to on wheels, and finished their journey afoot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a greenhorn I am not to have understood
that!&rdquo; declared the other boy, thoroughly
disgusted with himself for not having taken
the trouble to exercise his brain more in the
past, so as to be alive to such situations as
this; it galled his pride to have to depend on
anyone else for information.</p>
<p>Monkey came along and dropped out of his
saddle beside them. He was just as much surprised
and tickled at seeing the car as the
owner had been; but he did not immediately
proceed to ask questions. He knew what Hugh
was doing when he saw him bending down and
examining the surrounding earth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Just as Billy hove in sight and slowed down
so that he could join his chums, the patrol
leader remarked that the trail of the two men
ran off directly into the thick of the woods,
which at this particular spot grew rather
densely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I can&rsquo;t find the least thing the matter
with my car,&rdquo; Gusty observed. &ldquo;There seems
to be some gasoline in the tank, too. So that
they could have gone a good many more miles
if they&rsquo;d wished. Yes, you were right, Hugh.
They abandoned it for another reason. I&rsquo;d
even say they might know of some hiding place
in this region, and right here is a short-cut
to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a time you struck the right nail
on the head, Gusty,&rdquo; remarked Hugh. &ldquo;I
believe that&rsquo;s what it will turn out to be in
the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we push through the woods,
don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; queried Monkey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;And that means we&rsquo;ll have to leave our
machines hid away somewhere,&rdquo; Billy added,
with a ring of solicitude in his voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
like to do something so as to make it impossible
for anybody to ride away on my motorcycle
while I&rsquo;m gone. It would be a tough joke on
us to chase after those rogues while they came
back on the sly and hooked two of our precious
wheels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can fix that all right. Meanwhile,
Gusty, you disable your runabout in some temporary
way, so that it couldn&rsquo;t be of any use
to anybody until the missing part is supplied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great idea, as sure as you&rsquo;re born! I
can do it as easy as anything!&rdquo; exclaimed the
other boy, hastening to carry out the suggestion
without even stopping to consider that
only an hour or so back he would have laughed
scornfully if some one had told him that before
long he would be taking orders from Hugh
Hardin as meekly as any private in the scout
troop.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>All this took but little time, and presently
they were ready to advance along the forest
trail. Gusty found himself quivering with
eagerness to see how these boys would manage
to carry out the tracking part of the business.
Had it been left to him, he would have made
a sorry mess of it, he admitted to himself. His
pride was touched, and he began to reflect that
never again would he allow himself to be
placed in a position where even a boy like Billy
Worth, whom he had previously looked on as
rather stupid, could give him pointers. He
would learn these things for himself. Perhaps
he might even organize a new patrol,
and be its leader, if he only busied himself,
and stocked his head with useful knowledge
along the line of scoutcraft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s what they were heading for!&rdquo; said
Hugh softly after they had been moving along
for some ten minutes. He had several times
pointed out faint indications of footprints to
Gusty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it looks like an old abandoned road all
grown up with grass and briars!&rdquo; declared
Monkey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just what it is,&rdquo; replied Hugh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
expecting to run across it right along, because
my map shows where it lies. You see, once
ever so many years ago many wagons came
along here every day, some loaded with corn
or wheat or rye, and others taking flour back
home to the farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I know now what you mean, Hugh,&rdquo;
said Billy. &ldquo;There was a spot marked on your
map, and I read the words &lsquo;old mill.&rsquo; Yes, and
I remember hearing tell about some such place
up here in the wilderness. Thirty years ago
a miller used the water power of a creek that
empties into the river to grind his grist. Do
you think that&rsquo;s where these two thieves were
heading for, Hugh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like it,&rdquo; nodded the patrol leader,
pointing down. &ldquo;You can see that as soon as
they struck this sunken road they didn&rsquo;t even
halt, but started right along it, heading that
way. We&rsquo;ll do the same, and after this please
speak in low whispers if you have to say anything.
I don&rsquo;t believe that mill can be more
than half a mile away if it&rsquo;s that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>They moved on, all of them half bent over
as they sought to keep track of the footprints
of the two men. It was quite thrilling, Gusty
admitted to himself every little while. He was
enjoying it very much. If Boy Scouts practiced
this sort of stunt very often he did not wonder
that so many fellows had joined the organization;
and the resolution he had taken
continued to grip him more and more the
deeper he pried into the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I hear water splashing ahead there,
Hugh!&rdquo; whispered Monkey, who had a very
keen pair of ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we must be getting close to the dam
where the water falls,&rdquo; the patrol leader told
him. &ldquo;Pretty soon we&rsquo;ll know whether we&rsquo;ve
cornered the rats or not. Steady now, and
keep under cover the best you can. Remember,
not a sound, fellows!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><span class="small">AT RACCOON ISLAND CAMP.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;There it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy gripped the arm of the patrol leader
when he said this in a faint tone. Indeed, all
of them must have glimpsed the old mill at
about the same time, for the trees had thinned
out somewhat ahead; and that gurgle of dripping
water drew their eyes toward the spot
where the forlorn structure stood.</p>
<p>Having been neglected for many years, it
was now only a tumble-down wreck. The big
wheel was covered with green moss over which
tiny streams of water trickled to drop with a
splash into the pool beneath.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>In the eyes of Billy, it had a haunted look.
He admitted to himself that he would not much
fancy paying a visit to the old mill after darkness
had set in. Of course, he did not believe
in <i>ghosts</i>, for what boy will admit that weakness?
But even the presence of owls and bats,
and perhaps a prowling mink from the stream,
would be apt to make a fellow&rsquo;s flesh creep
if he found himself left alone in such a place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think they&rsquo;re there, Hugh?&rdquo; Monkey
Stallings murmured in the other&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody is, for a fact,&rdquo; came the ready
response, &ldquo;because if you look sharp you can
see a little smoke curling up from the chimney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gusty had not thought to glance at that part
of the mill before. Now he saw that this was
so. Evidently there must be some sort of a
fire within. And as the mill was said to have
been deserted by its owner years back, the
chances seemed to be that this blaze had been
made by the tramps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait here for me while I take a scout and
find out if it&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; Hugh told his companions,
&ldquo;and be sure to keep down, because one of
them might step out suddenly and discover you.
That would put the fat in the fire, and spoil
all our fine plans. I depend on you, Billy, and
Monkey.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;Count me in too, Hugh,&rdquo; urged Gusty, perhaps
considerably to his own surprise, for it
was a new role for him to play &ldquo;second fiddle&rdquo;
to anybody.</p>
<p>So Hugh crawled away. He went on his
hands and knees, and avoiding the open road,
chose rather to creep along where the wild
growing bushes would shelter him from being
observed. So cleverly did he advance, Gusty
noticed, that even should one of the tramps be
watching, there was little chance that he might
discover anything amiss. Plainly these scouts
had learned their little lesson and knew how
to play the game, he told himself, as he saw
Hugh sliding across a more exposed spot on his
stomach, hitching himself along almost as a
snake might have done.</p>
<p>Hugh was gone for some little time, and
then he reappeared, returning over the same
course he had taken before. Billy immediately
read success upon the other&rsquo;s face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then they are there, is that it, Hugh?&rdquo; he
queried when he could place his lips close to the
other&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I managed to get a look-in. Both men
are lying down, and I think they must have
been cooking something to eat from the smell
I got. One is smoking a pipe, and the other
dozing, every now and then taking a nip from
a black bottle that is passed between them. I
saw the short one examining a wicked looking
gun. I guess he&rsquo;s just the kind of a bad man
to use it before he&rsquo;d think of giving up to a
pack of Boy Scouts. We&rsquo;ve got to go slow if
we hope to win out here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the program, Hugh?&rdquo; asked
Gusty eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve figured it out this way,&rdquo; came the
answer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave the rest of you here on
guard while I make my way to the river, and
find the island where some of the scouts are in
camp under charge of Don Miller. All you
have to do is to lie low and never do the least
thing to let them know they&rsquo;re watched.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;But what if they take a notion to skip out?&rdquo;
suggested Monkey Stallings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you must be ready to leave a message
for us in a forked stick right here, while you
try and follow after them. If that happens,
make as broad a trail as you can, because it
will save the rest of us heaps of hard work
following. And above all things don&rsquo;t let them
capture you, because from their looks I rather
think it would go hard if you fell into their
hands. They&rsquo;re a tough looking lot all told.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say they were all of that, Hugh,&rdquo;
admitted Gusty, who had reason to know.</p>
<p>Before he left them, Hugh again examined
his pocket map of the country. It was fashioned
only as a sort of road guide for tourists,
but anyone could judge from the formation of
things about how far it was between the old
mill and the river at the place where a bridge
spanned the stream. And not a great way
above this particular spot, the island lay upon
which the scouts were in camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>Five minutes later, and Hugh replaced the
map in his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got your bearings all right, have you?&rdquo;
asked Billy, with more or less solicitude, for
everything depended on the leader finding the
camp of their comrades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon it&rsquo;ll be all right,&rdquo; Hugh assured
him. &ldquo;You see I expect to go back first of all
to where we left our motorcycles. Once in the
saddle I can soon find my way to that bridge
across the river. The island is only half a
mile or so above, where the river widens; and
I hope to find some sort of trail along the bank
where I can push my machine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you come back the same way?&rdquo; asked
Monkey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; Hugh replied.
&ldquo;The boys must have been tramping around
more or less since they&rsquo;ve been up the river,
and perhaps they may know of some short-cut
over the hills to the mill. But I&rsquo;m off. Don&rsquo;t
expect us until late in the afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! I hope you get here before night sets
in,&rdquo; muttered Billy with a quick glance toward
the weird looking mill as seen through the scattered
undergrowth.</p>
<p>Hugh did not have the least difficulty in
following the back trail. All he had to do was
to keep to the road until he came to a couple
of white birches which he had noticed hung out
in a queer way just about the place where the
trail had formed a junction with the overgrown
mill road. After that he kept his eyes mostly
on the ground, where he could readily pick up
the various footprints left by all those who
had passed along.</p>
<p>When he finally arrived at the place where
the motorcycles had been hidden, he hastened
to get his own machine in hand. Once he
started along the back road, he made quick
time of it. There was small danger that he
would lose his bearings, as Billy might have
done under similar conditions, for Hugh made
sure of things as he went along.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>In due time he reached the bridge that
spanned the river, which was quite narrow at
this point. Looking up the stream, Hugh
found that it made a quick turn some little distance
away. He could also see that it was
beginning to widen at this point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it can&rsquo;t be very far to Raccoon
Island,&rdquo; he told himself. Having jumped from
the saddle, he started to push his machine toward
the left side of the road.</p>
<p>As he had hoped might be the case, he found
indications there to tell him that some sort of
a trail ran along the river bank heading upstream.
Doubtless, parties going fishing may
have made it; and all sorts of people had used
it in coming or going. Cows even followed the
beaten track, for Hugh quickly discovered
traces of their presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not half as bad as I expected,&rdquo; he told
himself as he pushed on, though it was anything
but fun to urge that heavy machine over
roots and uneven ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>Hugh generally looked at the bright side of
things. He kept his spirits up when the clouds
grew dark and forbidding by telling himself
that it might easily be a great deal worse.
That is the way with scouts; they are taught
always to look for the silver lining of the
cloud and never to despair.</p>
<p>Twice the boy had to make a short halt in
order to wipe his streaming brow with his red
bandana handkerchief, and rest for a minute
or so. But he always started on again with
a grim determination to get there.</p>
<p>The third time he stopped it was to listen
eagerly. Then he chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to know that voice among a hundred,&rdquo;
he remarked. &ldquo;No one can sing quite
as well as Blake Merton. I must be pretty
close to the island camp right now. One more
push will do the business, I expect. There&rsquo;s
a fellow I know who won&rsquo;t be sorry, either.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>As he continued to urge the weighty motorcycle
onward, Hugh presently saw something
moving ahead of him. It was very like a white
flag, only in its center it had a blood red square.
He certainly ought to know a signal flag, since
he had learned to wigwag equal to the best in
the troop, and there were several experts
among the scouts at that, particularly Bud
Morgan, who had once worked with a surveying
party, Arthur Cameron, Blake Merton,
Walter Osborne, Sam Winter and Cooper Fennimore.</p>
<p>Two boys clad in the familiar khaki of the
scouts were standing on a little elevation that
was hardly more than a mound. They seemed
to be in communication with some one who
must be over on the island. No doubt they
were indulging in a little talk, partly for the
fun of the thing, and to improve their knowledge
of the Myers code at the same time.</p>
<p>Hugh stood still and gave the slogan of the
Wolf patrol:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>How-oo-ooo!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>This weird, long-drawn-out cry startled the
pair with the flags. When they craned their
necks and looked around, Hugh waved his
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! Sam and Cooper, how d&rsquo;ye do?&rdquo; he
called out, starting toward them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why! it&rsquo;s Hugh!&rdquo; cried one of the scouts as
though rather taken aback by the sudden discovery.
They had hardly been expecting that
the assistant scout master would get up to
Raccoon Island while they were in camp there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And say, look what he&rsquo;s got along with
him, will you?&rdquo; exclaimed the second boy astonished.
&ldquo;A splendid motorcycle as sure as
you live! No wonder he had to stay home and
wait for it to come along. Chances are that
Billy Worth and Monkey Stallings have got
the same kind of bully mount. Are they back
of you, Hugh? What news do you bring to
camp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty of things doing, boys,&rdquo; returned the
patrol leader. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll have to hold your
horses until I can see all the rest of the boys.
Time&rsquo;s too valuable for me to tell the story
more than once.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! do you hear that, Sam?&rdquo; cried
Cooper Fennimore excitedly. &ldquo;Hugh as much
as says there&rsquo;s something going to happen to
give us all a little whirl. Seemed to feel it in
my bones this very morning when I turned out,
that this day wouldn&rsquo;t go by as quietly as the
others did. Tom Sherwood said it must be
going to rain, and that was what affected me;
and Jack Dunham asked me how many helps
I&rsquo;d taken of that stew last night, because it was
a case of indigestion I had developed; but you
see after all it was what you might call a premonition
of trouble. Coming events cast their
shadows before, they say; and now I know
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you get back and forth between
the island and the shore?&rdquo; demanded the newcomer
impatiently, because Cooper Fennimore
was known to be a great talker, and apt to
waste considerable precious time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Sam Winter, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got a cute
little punt that they call a dinghy, which
belongs to the big motorboat. You can push
it with a pole in the shallow water, or use a
paddle if it gets too deep for that. Here it is
drawn up on the bank. It will just carry three
of us, Hugh.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s be moving across as quick as we
can,&rdquo; remarked Hugh, &ldquo;because the afternoon
is wearing away, and there&rsquo;s a lot to be done
before sunset, if we expect to capture the two
hoboes who held Gusty Merrivale up on the
road and robbed him of the money he was taking
to pay the men working in his father&rsquo;s
granite quarry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whee! listen to that, Sam!&rdquo; gasped Cooper
Fennimore, and then he hastened to push the
flat-bottomed little tender into the water and
take his place, ready to use the pole while Sam
handled the paddle.</p>
<p>As they approached the island, there were
evidences of considerable excitement ashore
and a number of boys clad in the familiar
khaki lined up to give their leader the customary
scout salute. This, of course, pleased
Hugh very much, for he was human enough to
feel a thrill of pride in the affection his comrades
seemed to entertain for him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX.
<br /><span class="small">OVER THE RIDGE.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to see you, Mr. Scout Master!&rdquo; called
Bud Morgan as the dinghy drew in to the
shore, and all the boys crowded down so as
to be ready to shake hands with Hugh. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d
you come up here, I&rsquo;d like to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! he&rsquo;s got the dandiest looking twin-cylinder
motorcycle you ever laid eyes on!&rdquo;
burst out Cooper Fennimore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s something more than that he&rsquo;s
got to tell us,&rdquo; added Sam as he threw his
paddle ashore, and made ready to follow it
personally. &ldquo;He said there was no time to
string the yarn more&rsquo;n once, so we would have
to wait till all the bunch had gathered around.
Get ready to quiver, everybody, because there&rsquo;s
a thrill coming for you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>Of course these words aroused the curiosity
of the scouts. Even as they shook hands with
Hugh, they were beginning to watch his face
as though under the impression that they
might be able to read his secret there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to start right in the beginning,
boys,&rdquo; began the newcomer, &ldquo;and tell you how
we three, Billy Worth, Monkey Stallings and
myself, planned to give you a surprise by running
up here on our new motorcycles, which
came the day after you left on the motorboat.
That was why we said we couldn&rsquo;t go along,
but might be up in time to share the homeward
voyage. Well, we had a great time practicing,
because Billy was bound to get into all sorts
of trouble. But we managed to get off to-day.
Somebody bring me a drink, please, I&rsquo;m as dry
as a bone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly his want was supplied, and then
Hugh went on with his brief story. As it is
already familiar to the reader, there is no need
of repeating it here. Hugh wasted as little
time as he could in bringing out the facts.
From the way in which those boys hung on his
every word, with eyes full of eagerness and
wonder, it could be seen that he was making
a decided sensation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>In a few minutes he had reached the conclusion
by merely mentioning the fact of his coming
to the island camp for help. Looking
around him, he saw that there were just eleven
boys present not counting himself. He also
noticed that Arthur Cameron seemed to limp
more or less whenever he had occasion to
move, as though he might have sprained his
ankle in some way; and that was an unfortunate
thing for Arthur, since it marked him
as one of those who would have to remain behind
in order to watch the camp while the
others were away on duty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call for volunteers to go back with you,
and clean up those hoboes at the old mill,
Hugh!&rdquo; suggested Don Miller, who had been
having his hands full keeping the boys in order
during the absence of both Lieutenant Denmead
and Hugh, and was only too well pleased
at having some one come to relieve him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;All who want to go, raise their right hand!&rdquo;
called out Walter Osborne, leader of the Hawk
patrol.</p>
<p>It seemed to be unanimous, for there were
just eleven hands elevated. Hugh smiled and
seemed pleased, though he knew that at least
two among the scouts would be compelled to
endure heart burnings through disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to me,&rdquo; he remarked quietly and
seriously, so that the boys knew he meant every
word that was said, &ldquo;Several will have to stay
in camp. Arthur, with that lame ankle, you
would hardly be fit to take an over-hill hike,
so make up your mind that this time you&rsquo;re
not to be in the swim. And Ned Twyford
will keep you company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He selected the last named scout because he
knew that Ned had been sick before coming on
this trip, and was not overly stout at best.
If there was apt to be a battle of any sort with
those tramps, then only the strongest boys
should be allowed to take part in it, Hugh concluded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>Ned bit his lips as though in protest; but
he knew better than to give vent openly to his
disappointment. A scout learns to obey without
questioning when it is a superior who gives
the order; and in this way he shows that he
has some of the elements of a true soldier in
him though fighting is foreign to his training,
and it must be resorted to only when all other
means fail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How will we go, Hugh?&rdquo; asked Bud Morgan,
who had stepped over to one of the tents
and reappeared, bearing a baseball bat in his
hands.</p>
<p>His example started the others to skirmishing
around in search of clubs. One of the boys
strapped on his camp hatchet; another secured
the belt that held his hunting knife. Still more
found various-sized sticks to their liking. One
and all looked grim and determined, as though
they realized that this expedition was not in
the nature of a picnic, but a serious undertaking,
indeed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was hoping that some of you might know
a short-cut over the hill in the direction of
that abandoned grist mill?&rdquo; Hugh observed,
looking straight at Don Miller.</p>
<p>The smile that immediately broke out on the
face of the Fox leader told him that he was
about to receive reassuring news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do know a way over,&rdquo; Don hastened to
say. &ldquo;Fact is some of us had heard about that
old mill, and knew about where it lay. So just
the day before yesterday, Arthur coaxed me to
go with him. He said he wanted to snap off
a few photographs of the ruin, which was
worth while seeing, somebody had told him.
Well, we made a cut across, and found the
mill all right, but the clouds had come up so
black that he never took a single picture. Arthur
was feeling pretty bad about it, and made
me promise to go with him again before we
broke camp. Then, on the way back, he
wrenched his foot, and I had to half carry him
the last mile.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;You saw no sign of anyone around the
place when you were there, I suppose,&rdquo; Hugh
remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there were footprints enough,&rdquo; Don
replied, &ldquo;and we reckoned that parties sometimes
wandered up that way to try the fishing
in the pond above the mill or in the runway.
But we didn&rsquo;t meet anybody, if that&rsquo;s what you
mean, Hugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Don, couldn&rsquo;t you manage to carry
my camera along, so if the sun shines you
might find a chance to snap off those three
views I showed you?&rdquo; pleaded Arthur, as he
held up the little black box.</p>
<p>Don gave a quick look toward the scout
master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No harm carrying the camera,&rdquo; the latter
told him. &ldquo;If you get some decent views, we&rsquo;d
all like to have copies later on to remind us
of the adventure. Better be getting ashore
as fast as you can, boys. Every minute is going
to count, you know. Ned, if you feel like
it, act as ferryman, won&rsquo;t you? Three passengers
might crowd aboard if you&rsquo;re careful how
you sit.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so shallow that you could almost wade
with your trousers turned up to your knees,&rdquo;
one of the boys declared, but since they all
had their leggings on none of them started to
try this method of getting ashore.</p>
<p>Hugh, ever thoughtful, gave a few more
orders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hope to be back some time to-night,&rdquo;
he told Arthur, who would have to remain
behind, &ldquo;but, in case necessity keeps us from
doing it, we ought to take something to eat
along to serve as a snack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s sensible advice, I must say,&rdquo;
remarked Walter Osborne. &ldquo;It is tough to lie
down to sleep on an empty stomach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I generally lie on my back!&rdquo; put in Tom
Sherwood quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that accounts for your snoring so
loud,&rdquo; he was told by one of the others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>Meanwhile the ferrying process was in full
blast. When Ned had landed three of the
scouts, he hastened back for another lot. After
all, it did not take a great while to get those
who were going on the tramp ashore, there
being four trips necessary, since ten were to
make up the party that expected to hike over
the hill to the region of the old mill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m going to put the trip in your
hands, Don,&rdquo; Hugh said, as the entire party
stood on the bank. &ldquo;Look out for my motorcycle,
will you, Ned, while I&rsquo;m off? And if
there is any chance for rain get some sort of
cover over it if you can. So long as it&rsquo;s so
new and shiny I hate to get any part rusty.
So-long, and here&rsquo;s hoping we&rsquo;ll all come back
as sound of limb as we start out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same here, Hugh, and fellows. The best
of luck go with you. If you come home by
way of the hill, give us the signal when you&rsquo;re
up there, so we can have the dinghy ashore
and waiting,&rdquo; and as the party trailed along
by twos and threes, with Don and Hugh in the
lead, Ned waved his hand after them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>They were soon busily engaged in climbing
the hill. Don kept on the alert, for he did not
want to make any error of judgment now
that the scout master had given him free reign.
He had paid strict attention to many features
of the landscape when going and coming on
that other day, as a true scout is always expected
to do when on the move, and in this way
it seemed almost as though he were following
a blazed path.</p>
<p>Now and then they could look back when
an opening occurred, and secure glimpses
of the winding river and the broad stretch of
water where Raccoon Island lay. Once they
caught sight of the two scouts in camp, who
had evidently glimpsed their moving forms, for
they were waving their hats. The sound of
their cheers also came, borne on the wind up
to the high spot where Hugh and his comrades
had stopped for a minute to get their
breath, as the summit of the hill was still
above.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>All of the boys were young and vigorous.
They had also had more or less experience in
mountain climbing, so that their muscles were
fairly hardened to the exercise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The top of the ridge!&rdquo; announced the guide
as he came to a fourth pause, and perhaps at
another time some of the scouts might have
thought it their duty to raise a cheer at hearing
how they had surmounted the difficult
climb; but they knew better than to start anything
of that sort now without orders from
the chief.</p>
<p>Scouts on duty must refrain from giving
expression to their feelings, leaving all that to
the time when they are at play. They are expected
always to keep their wits about them,
and to exercise judgment.</p>
<p>It was down-grade after that, and much
easier for making their way along. Don was
showing commendable ability in following the
return tracks of himself and Arthur, for they
had saved considerable time and distance in
coming back, having learned where short cuts
might be made.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>&ldquo;We are getting close to the mill, Hugh,&rdquo;
announced the Fox leader, after some more
time had elapsed, during which they had made
good progress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, what&rsquo;s this right now over here?&rdquo;
asked Bud Morgan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little stream,&rdquo; Ralph Kenyon volunteered,
&ldquo;and like as not the overflow of the
mill pond. I&rsquo;ve never happened to get over
in this part of the country while setting my
traps for mink, otter, skunk, foxes and the
like in winter, so you see I can&rsquo;t post you as
I might were we on my old stamping grounds.
But from the specks of foam on the water here
I should say it has come over a dam not far
away from this spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I thought, Ralph,&rdquo; said Tom
Sherwood. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, I reckon we&rsquo;d
all of us better close our potato traps and talk
low.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;The mill is still some distance away,&rdquo; Hugh
told them. &ldquo;I know because that foam comes
from the creek tumbling down among those
rocks yonder. Don, you&rsquo;ve been here before,
how about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t get there for nearly ten minutes according
to my figuring,&rdquo; came the ready response
that proved the reasoning of the scout
master to be nearly accurate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I should think we&rsquo;d only have to follow
up this little stream to strike the mill,&rdquo;
suggested Walter Osborne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was what we laid out the other day,&rdquo;
Don told him, &ldquo;and it turned out all right. So,
as I&rsquo;ve luckily managed to bring you over the
rise and within touch of the mill, I&rsquo;ll only
too gladly turn over things to Hugh here. He
knows the lay of the land, I wager, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Sh! drop down, everybody, behind these
bushes!&rdquo; whispered Hugh. &ldquo;I saw something
moving over yonder, and chances are the hoboes
have broken loose!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X.
<br /><span class="small">LYING IN AMBUSH.</span></h2>
<p>These low words coming from the scout
master caused a general &ldquo;ducking&rdquo; on the
part of the scouts. Every fellow carried out
the tactics of screening himself from observation
according to his individual notion. This
one dodged behind an adjacent tree, another
curled up back of a friendly bush, while a third
might have been seen hugging the ground, with
his nose touching the virgin soil. Possibly this
latter class believed, like the foolish ostrich,
that, as long as they could not see anything,
their bodies must also be concealed.</p>
<p>And after all it turned out to be a false
alarm. Hugh himself was the first to ascertain
that it had been a rabbit bounding away that
had disturbed his peace of mind, and caused
him to give that sudden warning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all over, fellows, and no damage done,&rdquo;
the scout master told them in his cautious way,
though at the same time he could not help
smiling at the ridiculous attitudes assumed by
some of the scouts in their wild endeavor to
hide. &ldquo;Only a scared little bunny, as it turns
out. We&rsquo;ll go on where we left off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immediately every boy straightened up
again, and tried to look as though he knew
all along that it was nothing worth mentioning.
Several pretended to be looking on the ground,
just as though they believed they had dropped
something. A few, however, colored up, and
allowed sheepish grins to decorate their faces.</p>
<p>It was not very long before Hugh realized
that the scenery began to look rather familiar
to him. This would indicate that they were
getting close to the place in which he had left
Billy, Monkey, and Gusty Merrivale.</p>
<p>Now Hugh did not wish to lead the entire
command too near the mill. Something might
happen to betray their presence before things
had been properly arranged to surprise the
robbers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>Under such circumstances, if the &ldquo;mountain
will not come to Mahomet, why one must go to
the mountain,&rdquo; an old Eastern proverb says.
Accordingly, Hugh held up his hand to signify
that every one was to drop down and lie low.
Then he started in to make a sound that was
similar to the grunt of a hedgehog searching
for succulent roots under the trees.</p>
<p>Every once in so often the scout master
would grunt, and then wait. He fancied that
either Billy or his mate would catch the sound,
for which they must have been listening more
or less anxiously for a long time past. And
as all these things had been arranged beforehand,
the boys would know that it meant they
should begin to back away, so as to place a
little more distance between themselves and the
ramshackle building that sheltered the enemy.</p>
<p>Five, six, seven minutes passed thus. Then,
during one of the waits between the giving
of the signals, there came a troubled grunting
from a copse near by, which told Hugh the
others must be coming. He encouraged them
by getting part way up on his knees, and waving
his red bandana handkerchief three times.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>Immediately afterward a figure came stealing
toward the concealed scouts, which turned
out to be Monkey. When Hugh discovered
two others following cautiously in the wake of
the leader, he breathed easier. Perhaps, while
on the way over to the island camp and back,
he may have had more or less fear that some
accident would betray the three boys to the
wary tramps. The consequences would, of
course, be very unpleasant.</p>
<p>Soon the trio had joined the balance of the
boys, and, crouching among the bushes, they
shook hands all around. Why, even Gusty
Merrivale persisted in clutching the digits of
these friendly fellows! Circumstances beyond
his control had placed the rich man&rsquo;s son in a
position where things began to assume a new
aspect in his eyes, and the sensation in his
heart was so very gratifying that he allowed
himself to give way to it entirely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>Hugh, believing that they should all work
together, had Don Miller and Walter Osborne
as leaders of the Foxes and Hawks get their
heads close to his and discussed the situation
from many angles.</p>
<p>On the way across country, while he and
Don were keeping at the head of the hiking
party, the scout master had asked many questions.
Of course he knew something concerning
the outside of the mill for, at the time he
had taken that one scout around the place, he
had made sure of surrounding conditions.
Then Don had been all over inside when he and
Arthur had roved this way, and he was in a position
to tell how the place was arranged. Don
was a careful, wideawake scout who had long
since learned the value of keeping his wits
about him, not knowing when it might prove
advantageous to his interests to be able to describe
what he had seen.</p>
<p>Consequently he had been able to draw something
of a map of the interior of the mill, tell
where the rusty and worthless machinery lay,
and also just about where passing hoboes had
always bunked, as the remains of many a cooking-fire
proved.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>Beckoning to Billy to draw near, Hugh asked
him if anything out of the way had happened
while he was gone. Nothing had apparently,
according to the report of the Wolf scout.
Once or twice they had seen a movement in
the vicinity of the mill, as a hobo came out
to take a suspicious look around, or perhaps
gather up an armful of wood to keep the fire
going until the time came to cook another
scanty meal. But, as the three lads faithfully
kept securely hidden, their presence in the vicinity
had not been suspected so far as they
could say.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>The afternoon was pretty well gone. It began
to look as though there was not the slightest
chance for them to return to the island
camp until another day had dawned, even if the
shift might be made then. Billy understood
this, and, as he was a great feeder, he became
very solicitous to learn whether the boys had
been thoughtful enough to provide against an
enforced stay there by the mill. He also wanted
to know if they had remembered that he and
Monkey, and probably Gusty also, possessed
something like an appetite; and whether the
material to stop this squeamish feeling down
below had been carried along.</p>
<p>He was made happy by having several of
the boys assure him that they had stocked up
with more than one ration, so that soon Billy
figured he would have no end of a good time
making way with the extra provisions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing doing until it gets dark, seems
like,&rdquo; Billy told some of the others, for having
been in consultation with the patrol leaders,
he had managed to pick up information in regard
to the decision reached in the council
of war.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that strikes me as a mighty clever
thing,&rdquo; remarked Bud Morgan. &ldquo;An attack
like this is always apt to be successful when
made under cover of the night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Cooper Fennimore quickly, &ldquo;in
all the stories of border warfare I ever devoured,
the Injuns always waited till a short
time before dawn to rush the block-house.
Seems like folks sleep heaviest just before day
breaks, though any old time is good enough
for me to get in seven winks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think Hugh means to wait till
that late,&rdquo; Billy told them. &ldquo;From the smattering
I managed to pick up, it seemed that they
had figured on creeping up as soon as night set
in, and starting things to working.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud Morgan gripped his bat with vigor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t come any too soon to suit me,&rdquo; he
muttered. As a rule Bud was not of a vindictive
nature, but he could see that the Merrivale
boy had not only been robbed but cruelly hammered
by the fists of the two ugly hoboes and
it riled the scout considerably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see,&rdquo; mused Billy, while waiting for
the patrol leaders to complete their plans and
announce the method of working to the rank
and file, &ldquo;all told there are how many of us
on deck?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;A dozen, no, just thirteen, counting Gusty
here, who looks as if he were in a humor to
do his part in the fight, if there is one,&rdquo; observed
Tom Sherwood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um, thirteen is said to be an unlucky number,
too,&rdquo; grumbled Billy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let that bother you any,&rdquo; Jack Dunham
told him. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a single ounce of
superstition in my make-up, and only wish it
was Friday, the thirteenth of the month, into
the bargain. I hate all that clap-trap so much
that I always try my best to start things on
the bad luck day. And so far there hasn&rsquo;t
any trouble swooped down on me. In
fact, I&rsquo;ve had more than my share of good
luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe you carry a charm in your pocket&mdash;the
left hind leg of a rabbit that has been shot
in a graveyard at midnight in the full of the
moon,&rdquo; suggested Monkey Stallings mischievously,
at which Jack only snorted and curled
his upper lip, as though he could not find words
to voice his contempt for such foolishness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the sun setting, boys,&rdquo; remarked
Blake Merton uneasily, for he had never been
very much of a hand in any rough and tumble
game like football or hockey, and secretly
would have remained just as well satisfied had
Hugh picked him out to stick in camp with
Arthur Cameron and Ned Twyford.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bully for the sun!&rdquo; Bud declared, shaking
his head aggressively. &ldquo;The old chap knows
when he isn&rsquo;t wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knows a good thing when he sees it, anyhow,&rdquo;
added Billy yawning, for he dearly loved
to sleep, and the idea of the sun going to rest
for something like nine hours appealed to him
very much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The council is breaking up,&rdquo; Ralph Kenyon
whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; said Sam Winter of the Otters.
He picked up the rather tough looking
cudgel, which he had managed to secure while
on the way across the ridge, and at the same
time a flash of excitement came into his eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to make a very important suggestion
to the scout master when he has told us
what our part in the game will be,&rdquo; Billy remarked.
The others eyed him respectfully,
wondering what sagacious idea had come into
the mind of this comrade who was a boon companion
of Hugh&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>But now the three patrol leaders came up.
Hugh made motions intended to gather all the
others in a close clump, because he did not wish
to speak any louder than could be helped.
Though they had selected a retired spot in
which to gather and consult, there was always
more or less danger of being overheard.
Sounds sometimes travel remarkably far in the
woods, especially just as dusk steals out from
the shadows and starts to envelop all Nature
in her mantle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is what we&rsquo;ve fixed on, fellows,&rdquo; began
Hugh, who never made a practice of using
twenty words when ten would answer the
same purpose. &ldquo;Don knows a way by which
some of us can crawl into a sort of loft that
lies just above the place the two tramps will
use for sleeping, because of a layer of straw he
saw there. I&rsquo;ll let him take four of the best
climbers with him&mdash;they will be Monkey,
Ralph, Sam, and Blake Merton. The rest of
you will stick by me, and we hope to get fixed
so that when the signal is given the scouts will
drop and tumble in on those hoboes, hobbling
them by sheer numbers, so that they won&rsquo;t have
so much as a chance even to use their fists,
much less their guns. Get that, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As plain as print, Hugh,&rdquo; advised Bud
Morgan, &ldquo;but what&rsquo;s the battle sign going to
be, so every one of us may be keen to sense the
signal and act on the flash?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>&ldquo;When Don has placed his force just as he
wants it, he&rsquo;ll scratch four times on the floor
just like a gnawing rat might happen to do&mdash;four
times, no more or less, remember, Don.
Then, after waiting about a minute or so for
every fellow to get a full breath, I&rsquo;ll give a
whistle. Of course that will startle the men,
but we calculate to be tumbling in on them pell-mell
before they can begin to get up. Divide
your squad, Don, so that at least two will drop
with a squash on that short rascal, because I
rather think he&rsquo;ll prove the harder one to
knuckle under.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do we have the privilege of using
these, if necessary?&rdquo; asked Bud, holding up
the home-run bat which was his special property,
and had been brought along on the camping
trip in anticipation of some lucky chance
for a game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only in case of absolute necessity,&rdquo; Hugh
replied soberly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget that you are
first of all scouts, and pledged to try every
other means before resorting to force.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all settled then, Mr. Scout Master?&rdquo;
asked Billy eagerly. &ldquo;Because if you&rsquo;ve no
other directions to give us, I&rsquo;d like mighty well
to make what I consider a very important suggestion.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>The rest of the boys pricked up their ears.
It was not often that good-natured Billy
Worth conjured up any important idea in
that rather easy-going brain of his, and they
were more than curious to hear what it might
be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Billy, let us have it,&rdquo; the scout
master told him, &ldquo;and if it sounds good to me,
I&rsquo;ll be only too glad to incorporate it in the
program.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then if you stop and think what time of
day this is, Mr. Scout Master, perhaps you&rsquo;ll
remember that some of the boys are right now
lugging a whole lot of stuff around with them
that would be doing a heap more good if placed
where it properly belongs. In other words,
what&rsquo;s to hinder us from eating our suppers
while waiting for it to get dark enough to
cover our move?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several of the scouts began to snicker, but
no one looked unhappy. The truth of the matter
was that every fellow was willing to confess
that he had a vacancy in his system that
was crying out to be filled, and they had long
ago learned in school that Nature abhors a
vacuum.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>Even Hugh chuckled, as though the idea was
not displeasing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a sensible remark of yours, Billy,&rdquo;
he said readily enough, &ldquo;and after all, we&rsquo;ll feel
better qualified to do great deeds if we
strengthen our systems with our regular feed
that comes along about this time every evening.
So I&rsquo;ll appoint you a committee of one
to ask the fellows to divvy up. And, please,
no talking while we eat, unless it&rsquo;s in whispers.
This is no time for joking, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy found no great difficulty in getting the
boys who carried the &ldquo;snacks&rdquo; to place them
in a great heap in front of Hugh. It looked
like a tremendous amount of provisions when
every fellow had unloaded; but when one remembered
that thirteen lusty boyish appetites
had to be satisfied, that mountain of bread and
crackers and cheese did not seem so alarming
after all. In fact, it would be next door to a
miracle if a shred of food remained when all
would announce themselves contented.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>There was a busy time for thirteen pairs of
jaws for the next quarter of an hour. And,
after that, no one found any reason to complain
because of having to carry rations, since
there wasn&rsquo;t so much as a single sandwich left
to give them trouble.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI.
<br /><span class="small">WHEN THE RAT SCRATCHED.</span></h2>
<p>It was almost dark.</p>
<p>These lads were accustomed to camping out,
and believed that they knew nearly all about
the many sounds likely to be heard in the
woods around that region. However, the fact
that stories had been told about the old mill
being haunted gave several of them an uneasy
feeling.</p>
<p>Since few persons ever came up here, there
having been no grist in the hopper of the mill
for many years, Nature had taken back her
own. Everywhere bushes, vines, briars and
weeds abounded, and the little wild animals
frisked about under the trees as though they
looked upon that spot as their especial domain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>Night birds, too, began to croak and utter
their various doleful cries, particularly a family
of screech owls that called to one another
with whinnies and long-drawn loving notes.</p>
<p>Then there was the constant fretful murmur
of the water, dripping over the moss-covered
wheel of the mill, or forcing a passage through
crevices of the dam. Taken all together,
things conspired to make some of the boys
shrug their shoulders, and keep rather close to
their mates under the conviction that there is
strength in union.</p>
<p>Besides all this they could not forget that
they meant to assail a couple of &ldquo;tough nuts,&rdquo;
as Billy called the pair of hobo yeggmen in
the mill. This alone was sufficient to strain
their courage, for they were but boys.</p>
<p>Every one was pleased though, when the
word came to start moving. Action is far preferable
to lying idle and suffering the pangs
of anxiety and uncertainty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>Each scout seemed to feel that he was on
his mettle to do his level best. Gusty Merrivale
took pattern from the rest, and really acquitted
himself in a way to satisfy Hugh that he had
the elements to make a good member of the
troop, if he still continued to cherish his present
desire to join them later on.</p>
<p>Soon they could catch fugitive glimpses of a
faint gleam of light ahead. Every one knew
without being told that this must proceed from
some dusty window of the mill. The men inside
had a fire going in place of a lamp or a
candle. They possibly did not like the cobwebbed
interior of the place any too well,
and did their best to make it seem a bit more
cheery by keeping the blaze going, even after
their supper had been disposed of.</p>
<p>This pleased the scouts very much, for it
showed them how things lay. There was less
likelihood of any slip happening when those
against whom they were opposed arranged
matters so that they could be constantly seen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>Gradually the entire squad had gained a
place close beside the mill. Those who had
been picked out to accompany the leader of
the Foxes had been warned to be very careful
of their footing. In order to reach the
outer shed from which they expected to attain
the loft, they would be compelled to pass over
the wet and slippery apron of the dam for several
yards.</p>
<p>Should an unlucky scout manage to lose his
footing, while crossing the heavy planks at this
point, he might take a plunge that he would
never forget. Instead of capturing the tramps,
his mates would have their work cut out for
them in rescuing him from a watery grave in
the deep pool that lay below.</p>
<p>There was one thing on which Hugh relied
to help him out. This was the constant noise
of running water which he expected would
cover up any misplay on the part of a clumsy
scout.</p>
<p>Leading his own detachment, Hugh made
his way carefully to the broken-down door of
the mill. No one of the various casual lodgers
entertained of recent years in the abandoned
structure had ever made the slightest effort
to repair the door or smashed windows.
All they cared for was a fairly decent roof
over their heads that would shed water in a
heavy rain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>In consequence, there was no trouble in finding
an entrance to the building. Hugh, of
course, did not push in without first taking an
observation. He had learned caution as one
of the first things after joining the scouts, and
he knew the folly of not looking before leaping
in the dark.</p>
<p>The fire was at the other end of the mill.
He could see moving figures there as though
the tramps were not yet ready to settle down
to sleep. Hugh only hoped that no sudden
thirst would cause one of the men to think of
starting outside while he and the eager squad
at his back were creeping stealthily toward the
fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>One by one, the boys crossed the doorsill like
so many shadows. Gusty came last of all, not
that he was asked to bring up the rear, but
simply because he realized that he did not know
as much about these things as the fellows who
had been practicing scout tactics for months.
It was a new departure for Gusty to admit so
much even to himself, and showed the startling
change that was being effected in his once overbearing
disposition.</p>
<p>Now they were all inside, and so far everything
had gone well. Not a fellow had tripped,
or as much as made the least sound that could
have reached the ears of the two tramps.
Counting himself, Hugh had eight fellows in
his bunch; Don carried just five. Surely they
ought to be able to overwhelm the enemy by
sheer force of numbers unless they managed
unfortunately to get in each other&rsquo;s way. This
was what Hugh wished to avoid most of all.
He had even tried to give each member of his
force a certain place in the line so as not to
interfere with the rest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>Hugh led the advance. He used his eyes
to good advantage in order to locate each and
every possible source of cover, so as to profit
by the same. Trailing in his wake came the
others, striving to copy every movement made
by their leader, for they knew that Hugh was
a master hand at such things.</p>
<p>The hoboes seemed to be taking things as
easy as they possibly could. They lay there
stretched out at full length, smoking their black
pipes, and exchanging occasional words. No
doubt they had canvassed their plans for the
immediate future, and had everything laid out
ahead, never dreaming that danger lay near
at hand.</p>
<p>Gusty, coming along in the rear, found himself
unaccountably moved as he crept after one
of the scouts. His initiation into some of the
exciting episodes that are likely to come the
way of active members of a patrol had been
unusually thrilling. He was having the best
time of his life, and he realized that after all
he had it in him right along to participate in
such delightful happenings, though never until
the present awakening to the fact.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>Meanwhile Hugh, in the van, had decided
just where he and his followers must come to
a halt. They could not get quite as close to
the lounging men as he would have liked.
He expected the scouts in the loft to be in a
position to strike the first blow.</p>
<p>They were no longer moving at the pace
which had marked their entrance into the old
mill. A snail could hardly have wriggled along
slower than Hugh was doing at this stage of
the proceedings, so at least Bud Morgan
thought. Bud, however, had always been inclined
toward haste in most things he undertook.
Therefore, he could be hardly looked
upon as a good judge.</p>
<p>At a previous time there had been a half-hearted
attempt made to start operations, looking
to rebuilding the falling walls of the abandoned
mill. It had been given up as hopeless,
but, at the same time, quite a pile of stones
had been carried into the place. By good luck
it came about that this heap was just where
it could be utilized by the scouts. Indeed, it
had served them as a splendid cover more than
half the time while they were creeping forward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>Behind it they ranged, still on their hands
and knees. The fire flickered, and occasionally
snapped as some brittle section of wood was
greedily seized upon by the flames. Deep and
harsh sounded the voices of the lounging
tramps. Lazily the wreaths of smoke curled
upward from their pipes.</p>
<p>Hugh was fully awake to making his arrangements
while the chance remained. He
had it fixed so that about half of his force
hovered near one end of the rock pile, while
the rest waited close to the other termination.</p>
<p>Some of the scouts were holding themselves
in just such positions as they would have assumed
had they been entered for a fifty-yard
sprint, and at the sound of the pistol expected
to fairly shoot away. They crouched low, with
their finger tips placed on the rough deal
planks of the floor of the mill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>Every fellow was wondering how Don Miller
and his four climbers might be making out.
They had had ample time, it would seem, to
cover the ground; and it was to be hoped that
not many more minutes would elapse before
the scratching of the imaginary rat four times
would tell Hugh that all was ready.</p>
<p>If ever boys were keyed up to top-notch
fever, those seven were who lay back of the
friendly rock pile, and counted the passing
seconds. Every nerve in their whole bodies
seemed on edge. Small sounds were terribly
magnified; and several times one or the other
of them would fancy that he had caught the
eagerly expected signal from the leader of the
Fox patrol up there in the dense gloom of the
loft just above where the tramps lay on their
hay.</p>
<p>Oh! it was cruel the way Don Miller held
off! Could anything have happened to upset
his share in the general plan? Had one of his
command slipped on those mossy and slimy
planks of the dam, and fallen in? Since they
had heard nothing that sounded like an alarm
it did not seem possible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>And then at last it came&mdash;one, two, three,
four&mdash;plain scratches, as though an industrious
rat had set himself a gigantic task.</p>
<p>It was time!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII.
<br /><span class="small">WHAT THE SCOUTS DID.</span></h2>
<p>Every one of those eight boys plainly heard
the long awaited sounds, even Gusty, who was
quite as anxious as any of his new friends.
Immediately each wearer of a soiled khaki suit
followed the instructions of their leader, and
drew in a full round breath so as to be ready
for the next act in the little drama. This
would come in the form of action, if their program
could be followed out as closely as it was
intended to be.</p>
<p>A few seconds ensued. Plainly Hugh had
himself well in hand, and would not allow anything
to rattle him. Before giving the signal
that would precipitate a startling change in
the situation, he wished to make sure that the
two lounging tramps had not taken the alarm
because of the scratching sounds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>This was quickly settled. The shorter fellow
did raise his head a trifle as if he may have
considered that it was an unusually methodical
rodent that bit into the wood with such regularity.
But then as the men had been eating,
and doubtless crumbs of food must have been
scattered about on the floor, perhaps it was
this that had excited the sleek little animal
on the other side of the wall.</p>
<p>Wandering Willies as a rule become accustomed
to having rats for bed fellows on many
occasions, so that there is nothing about the
presence of such vermin to dismay them. The
shorter tramp only maintained that listening
attitude for a brief spell; then he once more
dropped back and resumed his easy position.</p>
<p>Hugh knew it was time. He felt sure that
Don Miller and those with him up in the dark
loft had measured their distance, and were in a
position to drop directly upon the recumbent
rascals underneath.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>He had pursed up his lips ready to give the
whistle agreed on, and no sooner was the
squatty hobo reclining again at full length
than it came. Clear and sharp the sound rang
out. No bugle call, ever blown, brought about
a speedier result.</p>
<p>Every scout was instantly in action. The
boys who were so impatiently waiting in the
shelter of that rock pile, shot forward like so
many agile panthers, and every fellow was
aiming to project his form straight at the spot
where the tramps had been stretched out at
their ease.</p>
<p>Of course the wary rogues realized that they
were about to become the victims of some sort
of cleverly arranged trap. The first glimpse
they had of khaki-clad figures bouncing up
like a flock of sheep, and even filling the very
air must have given them the startling idea that
they were attacked by a regiment of State&rsquo;s
troops. They had no time to grasp the situation,
for already boys were plunging recklessly
down from the loft over their heads, and alighting
full upon the men, not giving them a
chance to get to their knees, much less their
feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>In three seconds the scene was a wild one,
indeed. Half a dozen scouts seemed to be
fairly covering each of the tramps, striking
and dragging and hanging on like crazy
leeches. The strong men tried as hard as they
could to get up, but to no avail. Above the
tumult the clear trumpet tones of the scout
master could be heard urging his followers to
hold on like grim death, and cheering them on,
at the same time doing his level best to keep
the flail-like arms of the hoboes from damaging
any of the boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surrender, both of you, or you&rsquo;ll get the
worst pounding you ever knew!&rdquo; shrilled Billy
Worth, as he kept bringing both his fists down
on the head of the shorter rascal very much
after the style of a rapid-action pile-driver.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>Bud Morgan was much in evidence with
that baseball bat of his. He did not have the
heart to use it upon the craniums of the men,
but kept shoving them backward again and
again when it looked as though they might
get to their feet in spite of the various figures
clinging to their arms and legs.</p>
<p>This sort of thing lasted for perhaps a full
minute. It may have been much more than
that, for no one was in a position to take note
of the passage of time, being wholly occupied
with the work of attack and defense.</p>
<p>With half a dozen-boys busily employed
in mixing things up for each of the men, the
tramps soon had enough of the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e. First
the tall fellow gave tongue to indicate that he
would be glad to surrender, at which Hugh told
him to fall flat on his face so they could secure
his arms behind him. Then the other, seeing
how hopeless it was to try and ward off a reinforced
army, hastened to do likewise.</p>
<p>After they had both been secured with the
stout cords Hugh had been wise enough to
carry along, being parts of the very rope used
to lower Gusty to the ledge where the scouts
found him, all of the boys breathed easier.</p>
<p>Billy fairly hugged the scout master in the
exuberance of joy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>&ldquo;We did it!&rdquo; he panted, not having yet been
able to recover fully from his violent exertions.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re our prisoners of war, Hugh,
taken in fair battle! Hurrah for the Boy
Scouts, say I!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up to this point things had been so dreadfully
mixed that the hoboes had not been able
to understand what it all meant. When Billy
thus gave voice to his pent-up feelings, the
shorter rascal rolled over on his back, raised
his head as well as his bound condition would
allow, and took a good look at their captors.
Then he laughed harshly as though completely
disgusted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, wot d&rsquo;ye know about it, Pete? We&rsquo;ve
gone an&rsquo; got cotched by a parcel o&rsquo; kids, arter
all! Me to the pen arter this. I&rsquo;d be afraid
o&rsquo; bein&rsquo; left alone in the dark for fear o&rsquo;
ghosts. Sure we&rsquo;re a couple o&rsquo; greenies to let
Boy Scouts round us up. I wish somebody&rsquo;d
kick me, so&rsquo;s to find out if I&rsquo;m awake or only
dreamin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>Nobody volunteered to perform this kind
office for him. The scouts were quite willing,
but had some consideration for the feelings
of those whom the fortunes of war chanced
to throw into their hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gusty, do you know how much money they
took from you?&rdquo; asked the scout master as he
looked up from searching the pockets and
clothing of the pair.</p>
<p>He had his hands full of bills, and quite a
hefty pile of silver lay on the floor of the mill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I drew exactly fourteen hundred and sixty-three
dollars from the bank,&rdquo; replied the other,
his face lighted up with a happy smile; &ldquo;thirty
of it was in silver, so as to make change in the
pay of the men, who are on piece work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Count this then,&rdquo; continued Hugh, &ldquo;and
as they haven&rsquo;t had any chance to get rid of a
red cent, I should think you&rsquo;d find it all here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>To their surprise it turned out that there
was considerably more than that amount, some
sixty-two dollars in fact. This proved that
Pete and Bill could not have been &ldquo;dead broke&rdquo;
at the time they laid that trap in order to stop
the rich man&rsquo;s son on the road, and rob him of
the quarrymen&rsquo;s wages.</p>
<p>Gusty was greatly pleased. It was not altogether
because he had recovered both his
runabout and the money taken from him.
There was something even more delightful in
the knowledge that he himself had shared in
the capture of the robbers, having done his
part of the work of pulling the tall man down.
And the new sensation gave him such a splendid
feeling that he was already looking on
every one of the scouts as a brother, whose
further acquaintance he meant to zealously
cultivate.</p>
<p>As it was unreasonable to think of returning
to the island camp that night, the boys set
about making themselves as comfortable as
the conditions allowed. When the fire had
been replenished, things began to take on a
more cheerful air. Even the sad murmur of
the dropping water outside no longer inspired
Billy and a few more of the boys with
thoughts of haunted houses and the like. In
fact they rather liked it now, though sticking
close to the inside of the mill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>Still that was a very long night. Few of
the scouts save Billy Worth secured any sleep
to mention; but nothing could ever keep him
from losing himself to the world.</p>
<p>Hugh often went over to where the two
men were, and examined their bonds so as to
make sure that they were not breaking loose.
He had taken a wicked-looking gun from each
tramp, and managed to let them understand
that he carried one of these with him for better
protection.</p>
<p>When day broke, the scouts were early astir.
It had been planned to start over the ridge
toward the river so as to reach the island camp
by breakfast time.</p>
<p>Although all of them were ferociously hungry,
the boys made merry as they trailed along.
They felt that they had managed to do something
that would add another triumph to the
already long list of praiseworthy deeds credited
to the troop.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>In due time they passed over the divide. As
agreed on, Hugh immediately gave the signal
to the two boys in camp that they were coming,
so that they might get busy with a bumper
breakfast. Billy declared that he was ready to
eat them out of house and home, such was the
sharp appetite this early morning climb had
given him.</p>
<p>The scout salute met the victorious army on
its arrival, and for a brief time the air was
filled with the totem cries of the various patrols,
Wolf, Hawk, Fox and Otter combined
in one grand p&aelig;an of victory.</p>
<p>Arthur Cameron was delighted because the
friendly scout to whom he had entrusted his
camera had made sure to take several pictures
of the group with their prisoners at the
mill, and again on the way over the wild uplift
that separated the scene of their late adventure
from the river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>First of all, Hugh, after breakfast had been
enjoyed, carried Monkey to the place where
the other two motorcycles had been left. Then
he went back and conveyed Billy the same way.
This left only the runabout to be looked after,
and as they must use this in order to get their
prisoners to town, the scout master once more
made the trip with a passenger seated behind
his saddle.</p>
<p>It promised to be a busy day indeed for
some of the scouts. Hugh decided to accompany
Gusty when the two prisoners were taken
to town. Then the latter meant to start once
more for the quarries with the money for the
semimonthly payroll. Doubtless there would
be more or less anxiety up there on account of
his failure to arrive on the specified day.</p>
<p>Seeing that they were so near the quarries,
Hugh finally changed his mind and had Gusty
first of all run over with the money. After
that they loaded the two bound men into the
car, and managed to find places for themselves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>The hoboes were delivered safely to the police,
and were promptly recognized as men
long wanted for other crimes along the line
of looting country stores. Once again praise
of the scouts was on everybody&rsquo;s lips, and
they made new friends all around their home
town.</p>
<p>Gusty pleaded with Hugh to be taken back
to the island camp in order to get better acquainted
with those whom he meant to join
later on; and, pleased with the way things had
turned out, the scout master was only too glad
to accommodate him.</p>
<p>They still had several days ahead of them
before the return voyage was to be undertaken,
down the river and home by a circuitous
route. Hugh decided to manage to
take his motorcycle aboard and keep company
with the others, for he wished to show Gusty
so many things connected with scoutcraft that
he begrudged losing any time. Besides, Hugh
believed in striking while the iron was hot; and
he did not mean that this eagerness on the part
of Gusty should find a chance to wane until he
was a full-fledged tenderfoot scout.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>The return journey was made safely, though
of course, not without excitement and fun.
As vacation time was now near its close, the
boys fancied that they would have to turn their
thoughts somewhere else for amusement. It
happened, however, that events were shaping
throughout the home town in a manner to enlist
Hugh and his comrades in an enterprise
calculated to show the scouts in quite another
light than that of the past, in which they
had figured so prominently.</p>
<p>Just what these events were, and how well
the wearers of the honored khaki bore themselves
in the test, will be made plain in the
next story of this series, under the name of
&ldquo;Boy Scouts for City Improvement.&rdquo;</p>
